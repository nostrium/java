# Blog design notes

People write blogs to document something that happened.
Some of those people don't care if someone else reads
the blog post, but many others will care about that.

Nowadays blog posts fail because they are difficult to
be noticed by other people since most of them are
interacting inside specific platforms and things outside
of that platform are difficult to notice.

Not impossible, just really difficult to setup the
needed tools and plugins to make it work for most.

## Examples to follow

Here is how a role-model blog post looks like:
[https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2024/09/http-ftp-and-dict/](https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2024/09/http-ftp-and-dict/)

Based on static pages, the URL is defining the date
and the page itself is content driven, without 
distractions. If you look inside, it has useful
stats like the number of views and comments.

Comments can be made on the page itself, or through
other networks (supporting Mastodon and HN). This
guarantees a higher change of interaction/visibility.


To help blogposters reach higher visibility/success,
this platform should make such actions enabled by
default for them. This is already easy with NOSTR,
the question is more how to add other platforms such
as Mastodon, HN, Bluesky and so forth.
