# Web Pages

Each user has free personal web pages hosting at nostrium.

For example for user "brito", the web pages are reachable
at the location [https://nostrim.online/brito](https://nostrim.online/brito)


## Main page / Index

When no specific page or file is specified, the server will
try to find an **index.html** to serve. When that does not
exist it will look for **index.md**.

When no index files exist, it will show a default page that
lists the files and folders inside.


## Markdown files

Markdown files are text files with a human-readable format.
They are popular on github and other code-related places
to show text without needing a special viewer/editor.

The file extension for these files is **.md** and you can
open them with any text editor.

When you open a markdown file from your browser, this server
will convert the markdown file to an HTML file so it can
displayed more confortably on your screen.


## Uploading files

You can use an FTP client to access the folders of your
account and then upload/download files as needed. If you
never used an FTP client before, our recommendation is
that you use FileZilla.

The server url is: nostrium.online

Username and password are the same that you use to login
inside the platform.

*Note*: FTPS is not yet available, only plain FTP.


## Where are my public files located?
 
Inside your account there is a folder called **public**,
all files and folders inside that folder will be displayed
as static pages for your account to your web visitors


## Quotas
For the moment there exist no bandwidth quotas for the
files that are available to public nor limitation on
disk space of what you can upload.


## Statistics
Download and view statistics are not available at the
moment for your files, but this feature will soon be added.
