# Server: QOTD (Quote Of The Day)

Launches a quotation server on port 17.

When you are launching in debug mode it will use port 1700 by default.

QOTD was created in 1983 and documented on RFC865.

The QOTD server provides an inspiring quote from the
platform whenever it is requested. More details can
be found on the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QOTD)
page. 


# Access the QOTD

From linux the simplest way is using telnet with
the following syntax:

```
telnet nostrium.online 17
```

You'll need to press ENTER twice but the QOTD will
be made available to you.
