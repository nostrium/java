      "content": "I\u0027ve been able to get multiple OSes booting fine under my system\u0027s native UEFI (also have TianoCore DUET installed but it is of limited use, mainly to work around issues, and Windows seems to have problems sometimes without it). It seems that flashing my BIOS erases/resets the NVRAM variables, also resetting to optimal defaults in BIOS does so as well. I got Fedora Workstation 22 installed today after multiple tries, I kept hitting an issue where it seems that the Anaconda installer couldn\u0027t write an entry to NVRAM for whatever reason. I think it came down to my NVRAM not having enough space for more entries, as well as duplicate Windows Boot Manager entries. I had to reflash BIOS and delete a few invalid entries with efibootmgr, which allowed Fedora installation to finish and be bootable. However, several hours later, Fedora\u0027s GRUB2 NVRAM entry disappeared, I noticed this after GRUB2 failed to come up on a reboot, and Windows loaded immediately. I didn\u0027t reflash BIOS or mess around with efibootmgr after Fedora installed, so I\u0027m not sure what caused this. Currently ArchBang\u0027s NVRAM entry is the active GRUB2 loader, but this may disappear too.\n\nSo I\u0027m wondering if there is a program/utility that can dump the entire NVRAM contents to a file, much like a disk image, and allow for restoring later. I\u0027m guessing the answer is no, generally not.\n\nThanks!\n\n"
