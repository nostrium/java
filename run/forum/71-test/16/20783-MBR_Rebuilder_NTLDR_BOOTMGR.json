You can choose between NTLDR (NT52), BOOTMGR (NT60). Note that we do not provide the boot files, you have to add them manually. Also note that it needs to extract a required tool. Make sure your working directory or temporary folder is not read only. This tool needs to be ran as administrator. Be careful while using this tool! IT WILL WIPE AWAY YOUR CURRENT MBR/BOOT SECTOR!!!  \n\n**What is does not:**   \n\nIt does not hack your USB or HDD or destroys your disks. But you need to know that \"Ralphsoft\" is NOT responsible for any damage to your system. If you face problems, just post it below.  \n\n**What it requires:**   \n\n- Administrator Privileges.  \n- A read/write working directory and temporary directory.  \n- At least Windows XP or higher.  \n\nThank you for using this tool!  \n\n[Click here to download this file](http://reboot.pro/files/file/534-mbr-rebuilder-ntldr-bootmgr/ \"\")   \n"
