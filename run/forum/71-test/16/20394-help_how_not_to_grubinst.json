I\u0027ve managed to navigate down sh\\*te street without a paddle somehow!  \n\nExperimented (fool) with **500** GB **NTFS** USB seagate drive hooked-up with \"grubinst_gui.exe\"  \nthought I\u0027d install grub4dos to secure **FAT32** 10GB partition (was secured by password)  \nnow opened.... (was)  \n\nAfter sucessful install the virtual **Z:** 10GB FAT32 drive disappeared and the NTFS drive  \nnow is RAW prompting me to format it!!  \n\nIt would be a shame to lose the 200GB(?) of used data from it.  \nIt might be possible to retrieve data using salvage software.  \n\nWith help (***please*** ) from your good lovely [Reboot.pro](http://reboot.pro/ \"\") members I\u0027d rather find a shorter  \nsolution that will stop me pulling my hair out!  \n\n... hmmm have a good laugh at the pic lol (can\u0027nt believe I did this)\n\n![2lcaejb.jpg](http://oi62.tinypic.com/2lcaejb.jpg)\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n"

For a long time the Grub4Dos NTFS PBR is 4 sectors long (2048/0x800 B).  \nWhat\u0027s again weird is it seems to be a \"generic\" PBR (no info about the partition). So no wonder the OS can\u0027t read the data from partition.  \nCan you show us each step you did in grubinst_gui?  \n\nWhat tool have you used to partition the disk? Was it \"disk management\" from Windows? If yes, which Windows version? If not, in that tool have you used GPT or MBR?\n\nLate edit:\n\nI was able to get similar results as you by doing this:  \nI created a 465 GB virtual HDD, mount it, used MiniTool Partition Wizard to create a 455 GB NTFS partition + a 10 GB FAT32 hidden partition; I then \"forced\" Grub4Dos installer to see it as a NTFS partitioned floppy by using NTFS instead of AutoDetect at FileSystem.  \nAt this point both partitions are unaccessible.\n\n"

      "content": "Thank you **DavidB** for helping me, it was years ago when the drive was partitioned, my memory does not serve me too well it may of been formatted using xp. I did have many partitioning software at the time.\n\nCome to think of it I believe perhaps the security software (name escapes me) created a 10GB secure area FAT32 (size by choice) then it formatted the drive as all data would of been lost at this stage. Yes, then all files were then added.\n\nThe secure area software was a \"giveaway\" and worked OK; but I found I could access/recover files from that area without a password, it served a purpose at the time; meanwhile I had many files in the **un** secured **NTFS** section.\n\nRemoving the secure area may of affected the NTFS partition files so I kept it!\n\nYour (Late edit:) seems to decribe what I had *mistakenly* done, I thought the secure area **Z:** (10GB FAT32) partition was selected to install grub but it may of been \"whole disk\"(?)\n\nRealising the error I then turned it to NTFS using grub whole disk (another error) yep I goofed big time!\n\n**Edited by dummkopf007, 21 March 2015 - 07:33 AM.**\n"
