I find a tool called AOMEI PE builder, which bootable usb is based on Winpe, following is official turorial:\n\n[http://www.aomeitech...e-usb-1004.html](http://www.aomeitech.com/pebuilder/tutorials/make-a-bootable-usb-1004.html \"External link\")\n\neasy,right?\n\n"

If AOMEI PE Builder is installed on a 32bit computer, the applications you add to Windows PE should also be 32bit; if the computer is 64bit, the applications should be 64bit. Only doing like this, the programs included in Windows PE can work normally. To check the type of your computer, you can right click the \"Computer\" on the desktop and choose \"Properties\" as follows\n\nNot perfect, right?\n\n"

It seems here 32-bit is more useful\n\n"
