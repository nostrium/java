They are based on the ASM1053 chipset.\n\n![415MxCjk48L.jpg](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/415MxCjk48L.jpg)\n\n[International Purchase](http://www.miniinthebox.com/ssk-2-5-usb-3-0-to-sata-hard-disk-cartridge_p1710230.html?litb_from\u003dsysmail \"External link\")\n\nIf you want to create it bootable, I suggest an active fat-32 partition at the beginning of the drive, smaller then 100GB (some computers can\u0027t handle booting from a partition larger then 100-someGB). Really a 20GB partition is tons of space. fat-32 to conform to UEFI specs.\n\n**Edited by venerence, 26 July 2015 - 03:43 AM.**\n"

Mechanical drives get expected speeds (\\~80MBps for a large copy, 5400rpm). I\u0027ll do a full review when it arrives, pictures and the lot.  \n\nThere is also the HE-G303 (which is supposed to be screwless), but I have no experience with that model, just the one I ordered.\n\n**Edited by venerence, 26 July 2015 - 09:23 AM.**\n"
