      "content": "Good :smile:.\n\nFor the record, there is a common misunderstanding (actually induced by a mass of \"wrong\" doocumentation, either provided by MS itself or produced by third parties) about the actual role of the Partition ID in a MBR DATA.\n\nJFYI:\n\n[http://homepage.ntlw...ystem-type.html](http://homepage.ntlworld.com./jonathan.deboynepollard/FGA/determining-filesystem-type.html \"External link\")\n\n\u003e **How partition types (do not) imply filesystem types**   \n\u003e\n\u003e Traditionally on PC operating systems, the partition type has been associated with one, and only one, filesystem type. However, this was never the intention, and in practice is true only for a limited number of partition types.  \n\u003e\n\u003e The intention of the partition type was to prevent operating systems from attempting to access, mount, write, or otherwise deal with partitions that they wouldn\u0027t know how to deal with (because they would exceed their preconceived notions of how large a disc volume could ever be, for example), or that would extend into areas of the disc that they wouldn\u0027t be able to access, or that simply weren\u0027t volumes containing files and directories at all.  \n\u003e\n\u003e The idea that the partition type implies the filesystem type is flawed in any case, for one very simple reason: Once a partition has been created with a disc partitioning utility, users can (and do) reformat it with any filesystem type that they like. Most volume formatting tools (i.e. \"high-level formatting\" tools --- mkfs and pals in Unix parlance) operate solely upon the contents of the disc slice concerned. They don\u0027t look for, and modify, the disc partition table to ensure that the partition type matches the new filesystem type.  \n\u003e\n\u003e \u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e What a partition type does is define which operating systems will attempt to access, mount, write or otherwise deal with the partition, and define the particular detection method that is to be used to determine what filesystem type the volume is actually formatted with.\n\n![:cheers:](https://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif)\n\nWonko\n\n"

      "content": "Good :smile:.\n\nFor the record, there is a common misunderstanding (actually induced by a mass of \"wrong\" doocumentation, either provided by MS itself or produced by third parties) about the actual role of the Partition ID in a MBR DATA.\n\nJFYI:\n\n[http://homepage.ntlw...ystem-type.html](http://homepage.ntlworld.com./jonathan.deboynepollard/FGA/determining-filesystem-type.html \"External link\")\n\n\u003e **How partition types (do not) imply filesystem types**   \n\u003e\n\u003e Traditionally on PC operating systems, the partition type has been associated with one, and only one, filesystem type. However, this was never the intention, and in practice is true only for a limited number of partition types.  \n\u003e\n\u003e The intention of the partition type was to prevent operating systems from attempting to access, mount, write, or otherwise deal with partitions that they wouldn\u0027t know how to deal with (because they would exceed their preconceived notions of how large a disc volume could ever be, for example), or that would extend into areas of the disc that they wouldn\u0027t be able to access, or that simply weren\u0027t volumes containing files and directories at all.  \n\u003e\n\u003e The idea that the partition type implies the filesystem type is flawed in any case, for one very simple reason: Once a partition has been created with a disc partitioning utility, users can (and do) reformat it with any filesystem type that they like. Most volume formatting tools (i.e. \"high-level formatting\" tools --- mkfs and pals in Unix parlance) operate solely upon the contents of the disc slice concerned. They don\u0027t look for, and modify, the disc partition table to ensure that the partition type matches the new filesystem type.  \n\u003e\n\u003e \u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e What a partition type does is define which operating systems will attempt to access, mount, write or otherwise deal with the partition, and define the particular detection method that is to be used to determine what filesystem type the volume is actually formatted with.\n\n![:cheers:](https://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif)\n\nWonko\n\n"

(good :smile:)\n\nIf the first few following sectors, namely LBA1-17 are as well accessible and writable, you can install grldr.mbr to the disk, but you will need a small amount of good sectors, let\u0027s say 1000 of them to create a volume to host grldr OR if a few more following sectors, namely LBA 1-63 or better 1-127 are accessible and writable you can install the WEE to the disk.\n\nAnd the disk will become normally bootable (to grub4dos).\n\nThen you have \"holes\" (i.e. bad areas, not everywhere, but in spots :wink:) all over the rest of the disk.\n\nNow if sector (example) LBA 238975 is \"bad\" and cannot be read or written properly, it is \"bad\", and it remains \"bad\" NO matter which filesystem you are applying to the volume created on the disk that comprehends that specific bad sector.\n\nYou are seemingly telling me that you attempted making a huge volume covering the whole extents of the disk and by formatting it as ExFAT the filesystem automagically marked those holes as \"bad sectors\" (and of course - but you failed to specify this, the available space in this volume is much smaller than what is should be given it\u0027s size)? ![:unsure:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/unsure.png)\n\nAnd that you cannot obtain the same (or similar result ) through a full format and running CHKDSK /R on a NTFS partition? ![:dubbio:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/dubbio.gif)\n\nIF this is the case, and provided that your (unknown) disk is compatible, you may want to \\*try\\* this tool here:\n\n[http://files.hddguru...ftware/Makebad/](http://files.hddguru.com/download/Software/Makebad/ \"External link\")\n\non the disk, and hopefully obtain an unreliable, with a senselessly filled up $BadClus, but working NTFS filesystem.\n\nBut it is also possible that the volume cannot be actually properly formatted due to the default placement of the $MFT by the XP format tool, which depends on size of the volume and on it\u0027s extents.\n\nThe extents of the NTFS partition might be critical and in order to find the \"right\" placement/size of it some experiments will need to be carried as while there are a few tricks/possibilities to \"move\" the $MFT, WITHOUT an EXACT, DETAILED map of the disk, it is impossible to even give you valid practical suggestions.\n\nGenerically speaking, on a 512 bytes/sector device, the XP FORMAT tool will create a NTFS filesystem with 4096 bytes/sector clusters with the $MFT starting at cluster 786432 with a size proportional to the size of the volume, but there are also other files, like the $Boot record which is 16 sectors in size that have a fixed address at cluster 0 ( ++relative++ LBA0).\n\nThere is a trick that - within limits - allows to have the $MFT at a different location/having an initial reduced size, that may be useful in this case, see here:\n\n[http://reboot.pro/to...disk-emulation/](http://reboot.pro/topic/18022-error-60-file-for-disk-emulation/ \"\")\n\nbut again, without specific data I cannot say if it may work in your case.\n\nOtherwise - if you are really convinced that the exFAT is the way to go, you can have on it a XP inside an image (RAW or .vhd) that was already tested successfully by alacran (see previous posts) or experiment with the Windows 8 BOOTMGR (hints given before in this same thread) or - again as said - continue where the experiments with the XP Kansas city shuffle method were left, but you have to consider how all these are either very experimental or downright new/unexplored/undocumented approaches, in any case all of them rather complex (i.e. NOT of the do that 1,2,3 kind) and will need, besides some time and patience, to be first tested on some surely working hardware before being possible to hopefully replicate them to your half-botched disk/hardware.\n\n![:duff:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/duff.gif)\n\nWonko\n\n"
