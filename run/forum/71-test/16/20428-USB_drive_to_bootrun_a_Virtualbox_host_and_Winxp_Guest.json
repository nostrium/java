      "content": "Hi all,\n\nAs the booting experts I am hoping I can use your expertise to find a simple, straightforward way to boot a usb drive that will give me a way to run a virtualbox host, that in turn will run a windows xp guest.\n\nI have tried a couple of linux distros (suse and Linux Mint) and have got no-where (Not enough linux knowledge).\n\nI have looked at hirens but can\u0027t figure out how to get it to run virtualbox as part of its minixp system.\n\nMy objective is to run a virualbox winxp guest from a self-contained, portable os running on a flash drive that will boot from pretty much any system that it is attached to.\n\nThe winxp guest works under virtualbox without any issues on winxp. Win7 and Win 8. It does not require internet access, so the problem of wi-fi\\\\lan drivers is reduced, but it would be an added bonus if it was available.\n\nI\u0027m not bothered what os is booted up as long as it will run the virtualbox host from a GUI\n\nThe software on the vbox guest will not run on anything newer the winxp SP2 and the connected peripherals are not supported on linux or newer windows systems (EOL Issues), but all work together inside the vbox.\n\nThis is intended to be an emergency stopgap\\\\backup solution for when the existing system falls over for the final time. Using hirens or other rescue software on the same flash drive (To be able to recover additional data, would be an added bonus).\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated\n\n"

      "content": "Like Steve suggested, I used [WintoUSB](http://www.easyuefi.com/wintousb/ \"External link\") to create an, ahem, quasi-legal Win2Go of my 64 bit Win 8.1 OS on a USB 3 drive. I also enabled Hyper-V on it and ran a VM that I migrated from VirtualBox.\n\nI see no reason why you could not install VirtualBox to the USB OS and run the VM from the same USB drive. It installed everything OK that I threw at it. Performance is pretty dismal even on a USB 3 drive and USB 3 port, but once it is going it seems to be OK.\n\nOne caveat - Windows 7 and 8(1) require re-activation if you switch the USB drive to another PC. If you keep the same drive on the same PC it will stay activated.\n\n"
