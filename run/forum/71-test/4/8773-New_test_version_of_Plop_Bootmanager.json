      "content": "\u003e **Tue 18/Aug/2009**   \n\u003e\n\u003e Here is a temporary test version. download now  \n\u003e\n\u003e Sometimes I am really wondering about some people. I mean some people that want to have the boot manager open source. I have no problem with this request, but mostly people that are booting Microsoft Windows over usb want the open source. I mean, they are using a none free and none open source operating system and dont understand that the boot manager is currently \"only\" freeware. Okay, they want that modified plop usb drivers will be integrated to other software like grub4dos. But simply making the drivers open source will not solve the problem to add usb support to grub4dos. Its much more difficult as they think. But who knows, maybe soon grub4dos has internal usb support. Maybe my boot manager became obsolete soon. Maybe the boot manager became open source. However, I will continue my work. I started the development, because I needed a boot manager that has the features I want. Years later I needed usb support and I added it. That was all for myself and it makes me happy to share the result of my work.  \n\u003e\n\u003e **Mon 17/Aug/2009**   \n\u003e\n\u003e Sorry, the new release is delayed. The EHCI driver hangs with VirtualBox. So I try to fix this and some other things.  \n\u003e\n\u003e **Sat 08/Aug/2009**   \n\u003e\n\u003e USB UHCI driver update: this week I bought a Compaq EVO DS 500. The UHCI driver was very slow on that machine. Sombody reported it in the forum (at page 3 you can see the pain and success message from me). Loading of zeroshell linux (grub, kernel and initrd) needed about 40 minutes or longer. Now I updated my driver with help of the real hardware and now grub, vmlinuz and initrd of zeroshell are loaded within 10 seconds! Yes, seconds and not minutes! Cool, or? :smile:  \n\u003e I tested the driver currently only on the Compaq pc. I hope the driver works with others too.  \n\u003e\n\u003e Plans for the next release: usb booting will not be limited to the first mass storage that is found. I plan to add some stuff that makes it possible to boot from the second, third,... mass storage device. But I have to kick out some things that are not really required (from my thinking).  \n\u003e The installer will be updated too. It gets a new option to setup text mode booting for harddisk installations. Sometimes there are troubles to init graphic mode on old machines.  \n\u003e\n\u003e **Tue 28/Jul/2009**   \n\u003e\n\u003e USB UHCI driver updated. Now its 2x faster. The driver update will be in the next release. You want to test the new driver? Then contact me.\n[http://www.plop.at/e...mngrusblog.html](http://www.plop.at/en/bootmngrusblog.html \"External link\")  \n\nSomeone (probably from this forum) seems to made him pissed ![:whistling:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/happy22.gif) .
