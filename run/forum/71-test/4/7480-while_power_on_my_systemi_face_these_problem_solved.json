      "content": "hmm.. sounds like a defective motherboard.  \n\nAny chance of returning it back at store to replace with a new one?  \n\nFrom what you write it may be several things.  \n\nDoes the motherboard beep when starting up?  \n\nIf so, are the beeps different from the expected when running normally?  \n\n-----------------  \n\nIf it doesn\u0027t even beep then it isn\u0027t probably running the POST (Power On Self Test) diagnostic, meaning that it\u0027s directly related to the motherboard hardware.  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nSome things to be aware:  \n\n- Bad power supply  \n- Wrong jumper configuration  \n- Invalid BIOS configuration  \n- Bad RAM modules  \n- CPU is dead/defective  \n\nWould recommend reading the motherboard\u0027s documentation to see what it says about the configuration and try to set it back to factory default.  \n\nIf everything else fails and seems beyond logic to solve then it\u0027s likely a hardware issue and nothing more can be done other than replacing with a new board.  \n\n![:good:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/good.gif)   \n"
