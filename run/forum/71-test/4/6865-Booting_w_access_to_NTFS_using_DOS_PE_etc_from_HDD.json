      "content": "Hi Folks.  \nOK, my quest HAS yielded some good results, but it has been a  \nvery long road and I see others here seem to have done similar  \nthings, but frankly I cannot understand some of the instructions.  \n\n(And before anyone asks me what I have been asked so many   \ntimes already...why I would want to have DOS access anymore   \nat all:  \nDOS boots FAST, I can do what I need in a matter of seconds, and  \nsometimes I\u0027ve had to reboot 3-4 times when something broke  \nbefore I had it fixed enough to get windows to even start.  \nMaybe newer is better for some folks, but I like to do what works  \nfast and easy with good results and for me DOS utils work fastest.)  \n\nHere\u0027s the original basis of my quest:  \nI have become very fond of win2kpro and quite used to it too.  \nWhenever there\u0027s any real problem I just boot to DOS - fix it, and I\u0027m  \nback in shape in a VERY few minutes.  \nC: is 2GB/FAT16 and I have DOS right in the boot menu. Nice \\\u0026 easy.  \n\nBut...I got some newer h/w that really wants eXPee - what with the  \nSATA and other stuff - it seems unavoidable.  \n(And of course there\u0027s no floppy drive in that system...)  \n\nBut....but....eXPee no longer easily inhabits only 1.2GB like a full  \nwin2k OS does - so my easy DOS access of the FAT16 partition is  \nthe first (and likely worst) casualty.  \n\nSo I am trying to get over my reluctance of using NTFS for my  \nsystem partition - and NO - FAT32 is not even an option I\u0027ll  \nconsider for even a single second.  \n\nAll I\u0027ve been trying to get was a way to very quickly boot into an  \nenvironment with quick access to a file manager - like DOS/Xtree  \nhave always been for me when using FAT16.  \n\nAnyhow, here\u0027s some of what I\u0027ve done:  \nI\u0027ve tried many suggestions and even relented and set up GRUB4DOS,  \nwhich I must say is a real pleasure to use; but little has proven to work.  \n(BTW - getting/adding/learning GRUB4DOS is so easy and fun as to  \nalmost seem sinful !)  \n\nBut GRUB4DOS refuses to boot any disk image but CIA Commander  \nfor me.  \n\nI found a utility that makes a bootable floppy with NTFS4DOS Pro, and it  \nworks well.   \nOn a system with a floppy, that is.  \n\nI searched around for ways to get that onto the boot drive either as a boot  \noption of it\u0027s own, or as part of another DOS, and found a thing called   \nVfloppy, which (when/if it works...) makes a PC boot from a floppy image.  \n\nCouple of problems though -\\\u003e Vfloppy is written in Chinese, and after getting  \nit to set up the image, it does boot into NTFS4DOS from the hard disk - but   \nthen it hangs before getting to the command prompt.  \n\n1st question:  \nDoes anyone have a better way to get real DOS for an NTFS centered PC ?  \n\nThe biggest problem seems to be that NTFS4DOS is having a fit from  \nnew-ish hardware and it has problems with some drives - this is known,  \nbut no fixes seem to be likely.  \nIt now fails from GRUB4DOS and CD booting equally.  \nEither it gives an error message - or just sits there and does nothing  \nafter it mounts and scrolls - even the customized version shared by  \nbootdisk.com mounts the drives and then just says \u0027invalid drive\u0027  \nwhen I even try to get a DIR to work on anything.  \n\nI tried the SysrescueCD (Linux) and it can be started from HDD,  \nbut it takes a long time to boot and only has the pukey midnight  \ncommander for a file manager....\\\u003eBARF\\\u003c.  \n\nGRUB4DOS will mount and boot from an ISO of some CDs, but  \nit is fussy and that function is still too experimental.  \nIt does a very good job of mounting and booting from floppy  \nimages but I have only found ONE image that will work AND  \nthat has good NTFS access, NTFS4DOS Pro barfs on SATA...  \n\nLike I said - I have been spoiled by the ease I\u0027ve had.  \n(I\u0027m still considering if I could get a W98 that boots from CD  \nand I\u0027ll add the free Paragon NTFS to it for the access I want,  \nand get that ISO to boot from the HDD...if it\u0027d work.)  \n\nI\u0027ve already run the gamut of being told I should use (and trust..)  \nsystem restore - but I already use RescueXP and a few others.  \n\nTrusting a windows OS to do it\u0027s own repairs seems to me alot like  \ntrusting the hens to protect the henhouse - and all\u0027s well UNTIL a  \nfox. \u0027coon, or a large rodent comes along - then it\u0027s all over with.  \n(And saving huge snapshots made by it, for it\u0027s use seems about  \nlike storing files I\u0027ve deleted in the \u0027recycle bin\u0027 - just plain stupid.)  \n\nFinally, after much searching I was able to find a post by Bart and  \nthat eventually lead me to the exact place I needed to be to get  \nBartPE running as an add-on OS from my boot partition;  \nViola ! Fast, AND easy.  \n(But still NOT as fast as a quick DOS boot and using XtreeGold...)  \n\nSo I now have a windows boot menu that has several entries -  \nnormal boot, boot with an alternate kernel in case the black screen  \nerror happens again, boot from BartPE on HDD, and boot from  \nGRUB4DOS, which has the normal entries as well as booting from  \na floppy image on HDD of CIA Commander for DOS access to C:   \nor other partitions that just happen to be NTFS.  \n\nOf all the boot options I tried for easy/quick NTFS access on this  \nnewer hardware - those are all that will work.  \n\nSo finally I have enough boot options so I can fix it WHEN it fails,   \nBUT, here is question 2:  \n\nI see there is mention on this board of AeroStudio, AVLGO, GRUB4DOS,  \nISOEmu and other stuff - but so much looks dated and I cannot find  \nwhere any of these would do exactly what I am looking for, for real;  \nWhat DOES work to make either a real-DOS or fast, HDD-based GUI  \nenvironment for file management on an NTFS-based system which  \nwill not boot into windows and needs repairs ?  \n\nThanks for any help !  \n\nsnowbear   \n"

It died !  \nGiven that it stopped in 2001 I wonder how/if it recognizes XP ?  \n\nSo, yes:  \n\u003e 2) If you want a REAL recovery partition, i.e. that is normally HIDDEN, you need to find a way to HIDE/UNHIDE it at will, which means that you need a 3rd party bootmanager.  \n\u003e I do recommend you XOSL,\n\nHere is where I stand - I have XP basically all set up as I want it, and that took a  \ngood bit of time, so since I don\u0027t want to do that all again and cannot narrow any  \nsearch well enough to see if there\u0027s a way to do it...  \n\n*Is there a way to simply \u0027move\u0027 an already done installation of XP from primary/active\nC: to an extended/logical partition ?*   \n\nI have many partitioning tools which will do the actual changes, but what concerns me  \nis the method to get a bootmanager onto the \u0027new\u0027, smaller, FAT16 primary, hide it,  \nand getting the \u0027moved\u0027 XP to boot and not see the primary while running ?  \n\nIf this strategy will require a total re-installation of XP then I will just wait for another  \ntime and stick with the recovery options I have right now rather than starting all  \nover again !  \n\nBest Regards.  \n\nsnowbear   \n"

Here\u0027s part of it....  \n\n\u003e The clue is that you install DOS which is not able to boot from NTFS directly to a NTFS partition without the need to change partitions, it will result in a fully appropriable DOS with permanent and full read and write access.  \n\u003e\n\u003e First you need to create raw image what this is and how to do so is described in the article raw image format. (dd if\u003d/dev/zero of\u003dc:\\\\FreeDOS.img count\u003d2000000) To prevent into the error \"Error 60: File for drive emulation must be in one contiguous disk area\" read [http://diddy.boot-la...s/files/map.htm](http://diddy.boot-land.net/grub4dos/files/map.htm \"External link\") and use contig or wincontig before you use the image the first time. The raw image will be called FreeDOS.img in this tutorial and placed at C:\\\\FreeDOS.img.  \n\u003e\n\u003e You can either install DOS to this image using a virtual machine supporting the raw image format (such as Qemu or Bochs) or you can install directly to this image on bare metal using grub4dos\u0027s device emulation features.\n\nTotally lost me - just makes my head hurt trying to get that idea into it.  \nI found freedos to be excessively troublesome and their community to be,  \nwell - impossible to find - it broke and I had no way to ask how to fix it.  \nDrDOS 7.03 on the other hand works like DOS always did, and has been  \nno trouble.  \nGiven that all the tools in that tute are free - I might try adding that if  \nsomeone has made the fancy image and shares it - but installing freedos  \nAGAIN ?
