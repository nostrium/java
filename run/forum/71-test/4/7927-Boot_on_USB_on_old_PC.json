You\u0027re right on linux system it\u0027s possible to run java programs and work with Excel document thanks to OpenOffice.\nI do know that java works on Linux and that OpenOffice.org can open Excel files, thank you. :smile:   \n\nWhat I asked was different:  \n\u003e You can try to see if the java linux version of beeblebrox works on your machine:  \n\u003e [http://beeblebrox.org/software.php](http://beeblebrox.org/software.php \"External link\")  \n\u003e [http://sf.net/projects/beeblebrox](http://sf.net/projects/beeblebrox \"External link\")  \n\u003e [http://sourceforge.n...use_mirror\u003dgarr](http://sourceforge.net/project/downloading.php?groupname\u003dbeeblebrox\u0026filename\u003dbeeblebrox-linux-0.0.3.tar.gz\u0026use_mirror\u003dgarr \"External link\")\nMeans:  \nI know perfectly well that java runs under Linux but I don\u0027t know if this specific java based app runs on your specific Linux machine/distro, TRY AND SEE IF IT WORKS in your environment.  \nThe old Windows version runs under Windows, while the new Windows java version does not (at least on my machine).  \nA partition table editor is an easier way to exchange info in \"human readable\" form (as opposed to hex bytes or hex-editor screenshots).  \n\nAs well this:   \n\u003e Do you have Open Office or any program capable to access an Excel Spreadsheet?\nIt\u0027s a plain and simple question that only accepts a YES or a NO answer :wink::  \nI know perfectly well that Open Office can open Excel spreadsheet, but DO YOU HAVE IT (or any other program capable of doing so)?  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n\u003e If it\u0027s possible I prefer to use very basic tools, so with ***dd*** and ***hexedit*** and ***fdisk***, I think I\u0027m able to follow your instructions.\nOK, let\u0027s see how it goes on.  \n\nWhat happens when you run fdisk on the stick with the modified \"modified\" MBR data?  \nDoes it detect the new data or it still thinks that the device is 1023/127/62? I seem to remember that it is fdisk **-p** :wink: to show current Partition table data.  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n:wink:  \n\njaclaz   \n"
