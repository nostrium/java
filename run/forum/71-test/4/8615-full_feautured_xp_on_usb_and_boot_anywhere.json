This is also what makes this build working on all hardware.  \n\n\u003e But then, where are the drivers to support \"all\" hardware?\nI think he meant, it works on all hardware, not that it supports all hardware. Same as for instance nativeEX_barebone. It works on all hardware, but is not even close to support all hardware. :tongue:  \n\n\u003e And if the \"source\" XP is \"clean\", and changes aren\u0027t saved, when/where are apps installed?\nIn the running \u0027Full XPPE\u0027, i hope. Cause PE \u0027installed\u0027 software will loose some of it\u0027s registry entries. Namely those which also exist in the clean XP. :smile:  \n\n\u003e Still, as I see it, it\u0027s a PE (sort of).\nSure it\u0027s sort of a PE, just as it is sort of a \u0027Full XP\u0027.

Network support is started after you merge the addreg.reg file into the registry and thereby make entries for services and maybe even the network card in the clean XP, which could collide with what PENetwork tries to do.  \nYou could try to run PENetwork before the registry merge.  \n\n@jaclaz  \nYou seem to be pretty focused lately on correct english.

The registry setting SystemSetupInProgress does!  \n\u003e It is quite possible to load a \u0027Full XP\u0027 with setupldr or a PE with ntldr. Though the adapting is usually a real pain in the behind! :tongue:  \n\u003e\n\u003e What knoppix does:  \n\u003e - augmenting a PE with all XP files --\\\u003e still a PE  \n\u003e - towards the end of the boot cycle he overwrites the complete PE registry with a \u0027Full XP\u0027 one. --\\\u003e To all files startet after this point, the OS is a \u0027Full XP\u0027. To all files started before this point it is still a PE.  \n\u003e\n\u003e So the end result is a hybrid system, with one part reacting exactly like a PE, while the other reacts exactly like a \u0027Full XP\u0027.  \n\u003e\n\u003e I would guess that the behavior of the system as a whole is mostly unpredictable, due to its hybrid nature.  \n\u003e But due to it\u0027s PE nature during the early booting stages, it will without doubt have the same ability to run on \u0027all\u0027 hardware that every PE has.   \n\u003e\n\u003e \u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e ![:idea:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/idea.gif)\nWhat you *think* **knoppix** does might be VERY interesting :smile:, but it is not what he reported doing.  \n\nHe reported that he boots a PE where the Registry and Windows directory has been overwritten (offline) with an XP one:  \n\u003e 1-i install a clear xp on my laptop with no drivers and no any more programs.  \n\u003e 2-install winpe to usb flash disk (4gb)  \n\u003e 3-on the full clear xp , i run \"regedit\" and export registry and save it; eg:addreg.reg  \n\u003e 4-then edit this reg file and change all path (c:\\\\program files) to (x:\\\\programs) and  \n\u003e (c:\\\\windows) to (x:\\\\i386) and all (c:\\\\\\*\\*) to (x:\\\\\\*\\*)  \n\u003e and copy this file to usb (i386\\\\system32)  \n\u003e\n\u003e 5- then edit \"software\" file where (i386\\\\system32\\\\config)  \n\u003e and add value to the (microsoft\\\\windows\\\\currentversion\\\\run) that \"hiderun /w reg import addreg.reg)  \n\u003e\n\u003e 6- **then copy** all files into the windows folder in the usb i386 folder (not only system32\\\\config folder)  \n\u003e\n\u003e ***then*** boot from usb\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\njaclaz   \n"
