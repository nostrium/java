When I extracted the boot sector of the disk it reads \"NATIVE CDFS GENERATOR.img\". When I try to put this cd\u0027s image file NP.ISO into USB using grub4dos and menu list like...  \n**find --set-root --ignore-floppies /iso/NP.iso\nmap /iso/NP.iso (0xFF)\nmap --hook\nchainloader (0xFF)**   \nIts not working. It halts with blue screen.  \n\nHence I extracted the rescue disk on the USB and tried to run the \"setupldr.bin\"  \nThere are no files on the root of the cd.  \n(All the files are in i386 folder. The boot loader runs \"Setupldr.bin\" from this folder.)  \nI used the following menu list but its not working...  \n**title qh\nfind --set-root /i386/SETUPLDR.BIN\nchainloader /i386/SETUPLDR.BIN\nrootnoverify\nboot**   \n\nPlease guide me in how to put this cd into USB.  \nI tried --mem command also but it Hangs.  \nI have 2GB Ram with C2D.   \n"

It halts with blue screen.  \n\nHence I extracted the rescue disk on the USB and tried to run the \"setupldr.bin\"  \nThere are no files on the root of the cd.  \n(All the files are in i386 folder.

(i hope it is ok since i have 0% interest in this thing ,and wont keep it in ANY case)   \n\nthe GOOD sustitutes and FREE are avira rescue cd and dr.web live cd . both based on linux and both are free. both can be booted from usb .both can be update on the fly or from net while in setup.  \n\navira is also good substitute for quick heal. and considers to be one of lightest and cool AV\u0027s which gives free version with full features (almost ).   \n"
