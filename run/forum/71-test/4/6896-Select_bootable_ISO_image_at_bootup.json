      "content": "Hi all,  \n\nI\u0027m new to the forum and to modern boot problems and solutions. I hope you\u0027ll forgive that and get me started in the right direction.  \n\nI want to prepare an external bootable hard drive (either USB or USB/SATA) with a library of bootable CD/DVD ISO images and be able to select, mount and boot the desired ISO image at boot time, just as if I had placed the selected bootable CD into the CD drive. These ISOs will primarily be OS installation CD/DVDs for various Windows workstation and server OSs.  \n\nI also must be able to use the drive as a regular storage device accessible from Windows when it is not being used as a boot device. And I also need to be able to maintain the ISO image library from within Windows.  \n\nI do not want or need the ability to have multiple OSs actually INSTALLED on the external drive, just the ability to select a bootable ISO.  \n\nShort of having a selection method at boot time, I could live with a solution that required me first to access the drive from a Windows machine, and either mark a particular ISO or copy it to a special location so that at the next boot from the drive, that ISO would mount and load.  \n\nIs this doable? What tools should I be exploring? If I can\u0027t do this, how close can I get?  \n\nThanks,  \nPeter.   \n"

Many of my clients don\u0027t use VMWare and want a variety of OSs installed on various machines. It would be nice to be able to have all those OSs on a single drive that I can carry around rather than a bunch of CDs which get lost, scratched, etc.   \n\nSo in what way is booting hardware from ISO problematic (other than that I don\u0027t know how to do it)? In what ways limited?  \n\nI guess the boot device needs to have some OS on it to present the ISO as a mounted CD, and then step aside to let the ISO/CD\u0027s bootup take over. I can see this being tricky, but would have thought that enough people would benefit to make it worth someone\u0027s while to work it out.  \n\nThanks for talkin\u0027  \nPeter   \n"

I have set up a GRUB4DOS loader to offer ISOs for an XP installation CD, a Win Server 2003 Enterprise and a Win Server 2003 Standard installation CD. The XP ISO seems to launch and get well into its routine, but both the Win Server ISOs stall right after the prompt to \"press any key to boot from CD\". The system just hangs with no error and no progress--the longest I waited was about 30 seconds before rebooting.
