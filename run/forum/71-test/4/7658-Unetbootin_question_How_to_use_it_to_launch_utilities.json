Can somebody please help me with this comment from the [Unetbootin page](http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/ \"External link\"):  \n\n\"UNetbootin can also be used to load various system utilities\". I would like to use it (from a thumbdrive) to access PartedMagic as well as NTPassword. Being a Linux novice, I was expecting some sort of instructions on how to do this, but can see none on the Sourceforge page.  \n\nCan somebody please advise me on how I can do this suggested task?  \n\nThanks.   \n"
