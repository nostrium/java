Bootin started, but then i receve message \"ntoskrnl.exe in section \\[SourceDiskFiles\\] broken or missed\". In google i find, that it because ntoskrnl.exe located in second part of direcrory, and if relocate record about ntoskrnl.exe in to the 1 part, then OK. May be, i don\\`t try it. But the same situation with other files ... too much handjob :smile:   \n"
