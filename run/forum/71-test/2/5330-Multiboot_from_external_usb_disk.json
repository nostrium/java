      "content": "Hi everybody. My question goes like this: I had several .iso images (Hirens boot CD v9.5, Knoppix 5.1.1, Norton Ghost Rescue Disk and Windows XP USB Edition) and an external usb hard drive of 60 GB.  \nI would like to know is there is a way to put those .iso images in my external disk and boot from it. The idea is: once the external disk booted it should shows a menu in which I can choose one of the above mentioned .iso files to boot.  \nI had read some manuals but none explain what I want to do.  \nThanks in advance for the hand. ![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif)   \n"
