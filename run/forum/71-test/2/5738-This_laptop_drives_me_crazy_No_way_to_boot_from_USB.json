      "content": "I have sony vaio (vgn-a) laptop..I tried every possibility that I can with every way that I read from this forum and other sources..but no no and again no..I could never ever boot my laptop from usb..  \n\nI tried different usb sticks, I tried different partition quantities and formats, I tried different softwares like FlashBoot, Boot2Stick, HP Disk..Tool, I tried different boot systems like dor, freedor, windows boot images, BartPE, I even tried to connect my (XP - bootable) 5\u002725 inch harddisk (from my Desktop computer) via usb (with the help of usb harddisk box) but the result was same \u003d NO  \n\nIt is turned into a fight between my computer and me..it drives me crazy..PLEASE HELP!  \n\nWhere is the mistake? My BIOS has an option in boot menu as \"Removable\". I am trying to switch my boot device both choosing it with using \"ESC\" at startup or making it the first place to boot in my BIOS settings. At the end I removed other boot options from BIOS and left only \"boot from removable\"  \n\nBUT MY LAPTOP NEVER EVER SEEs USB AS BOOT PLACE. If it is not functional to boot from USB at this computer, then why did they but \"Boot from Removable\" option to BUOS. There must be something wrong.  \n\nWhat should I do?  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nBy the way, my laptop has internal Memory Stick reader, so I tried every thing for that memory stick also beside of USB sticks, no boot was available from any removable memory device.   \n"
