      "content": "First thing welcome to the board. ![:loleverybody:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/loleverybody.gif)  \n\nYou seem to have managed to get into your first two questions the two biggest unresolved problems around. ![:w00t:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/w00t.gif)  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n\u003e 1) is there a way to make the bootable USB HDD that i have managed to make boot on other boards other than the one i installed the WinXP on? is there any thread that have the tutorial or instruction to this?\n\nNO, at least none that is straightforward or \"fool-proof\".  \nThe only known procedure is to behave exactly as for a motherboard switch:  \n[http://www.michaelst.../moving_xp.html](http://www.michaelstevenstech.com/moving_xp.html \"External link\")  \n\nXP has been DESIGNED to be NOT easily portable.  \n\nI had a relatively high rate of success moving Windows 2000 (which is much less picky) by simply removing from device manager ALL devices, switching off the machine, moving the hard disk (I am talking here about normal IDE/ATAPI HD\u0027s, not USB), put it in the new machine and boot, the hardware is re-detected from scratch, and as long as the appropriate drivers are on the system, it takes a few minutes (and a couple of re-boots) to have the system running. To manage different HALs, one can use multiple lines in boot.ini with the   \n/KERNEL\u003d/HAL\u003d switches pointing to different HALs.  \n\nBut the above is however VERY different from a PE based system that is REALLY \"portable\".  \nMaybe using the Universal ATA driver and the Universal VBE driver it would be possible to have an increased (but still limited) portability, with at least a small number of core functions working, but still the problems with SATA drives and motherboard specific drivers would probably be overwhelming.  \n\nMaybe one could use a dual boot setup with DOS and use a batch file with a program like ERUNT to restore \"on the spot\" a different Registry, but portability would however be limited to a certain number of PC\u0027s for which a proper Registry had been built and backed up.  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n\u003e 2) i\u0027ve seen few forums on booting the USB on non supported BIOS. My question would be is there a way to make the USB HDD bootable when there is no BOOT from USB HDD option? is there any related threads to this? since the one i saw on 911cd is not what i wanted to search on.\n\nWell, there are TWO kinds of \"not booting from USB\" BIOSes:  \n1) one that cannot boot from ANY USB device  \n2) one that can boot only from some specific device (for example from \"floppy\" but not from HD)  \n\nFor the first one, there is NO solution at the moment, some ideas are reported here:  \n[http://www.911cd.net...o...650\\\u0026hl\u003dBCDL](http://www.911cd.net/forums//index.php?sho...650\u0026hl\u003dBCDL \"External link\")  \nbut noone is developing anything of the like, as far as I know.  \n\nFor the second one, (typically some laptops BIOSes) through grub4dos and/or makebootfat \"special\" bootsector it should possible to \"work around\" the limitation, but there is no specific guide I know of, you\u0027ll have to experiment quite a bit.  \n\njaclaz   \n"

To manage different HALs, one can use multiple lines in boot.ini with the   \n/KERNEL\u003d/HAL\u003d switches pointing to different HALs.  \n\nBut the above is however VERY different from a PE based system that is REALLY \"portable\".  \nMaybe using the Universal ATA driver and the Universal VBE driver it would be possible to have an increased (but still limited) portability, with at least a small number of core functions working, but still the problems with SATA drives and motherboard specific drivers would probably be overwhelming.  \n\nMaybe one could use a dual boot setup with DOS and use a batch file with a program like ERUNT to restore \"on the spot\" a different Registry, but portability would however be limited to a certain number of PC\u0027s for which a proper Registry had been built and backed up.  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n\u003e 2) i\u0027ve seen few forums on booting the USB on non supported BIOS. My question would be is there a way to make the USB HDD bootable when there is no BOOT from USB HDD option? is there any related threads to this? since the one i saw on 911cd is not what i wanted to search on.\n\nWell, there are TWO kinds of \"not booting from USB\" BIOSes:  \n1) one that cannot boot from ANY USB device  \n2) one that can boot only from some specific device (for example from \"floppy\" but not from HD)  \n\nFor the first one, there is NO solution at the moment, some ideas are reported here:  \n[http://www.911cd.net...o...650\\\u0026hl\u003dBCDL](http://www.911cd.net/forums//index.php?sho...650\u0026hl\u003dBCDL \"External link\")  \nbut noone is developing anything of the like, as far as I know.  \n\nFor the second one, (typically some laptops BIOSes) through grub4dos and/or makebootfat \"special\" bootsector it should possible to \"work around\" the limitation, but there is no specific guide I know of, you\u0027ll have to experiment quite a bit.  \n\njaclaz   \n"
