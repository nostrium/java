      "content": "Hi,  \n\nFirst I installed Windows XP on my local machine, then I installed Windows Server 2008 Standard and Windows 2008 Enterprise. At this point I could see all the Windows versions in Window\u0027s provided boot-loader. Then I installed Windows 2003 and obviously this version could not recognize the Windows 2008 versions. As a result, the 2003 boot-loader only shows Windows XP and Windows 2003.   \n\nThis led me to Grub and now I am able to boot all my versions, but somehow they appear in two groups and I have to boot them indirectly through the Windows boot-loader:  \n1) booting \"root (hd0,0)\" brings me to the Windows XP / Windows 2003 boot-loader  \n2) booting \"root (hd0,1)\" brings me to the Windows 2008 Standard and Enterprise Edition boot-loader  \n\nWhat I would like is to boot from Grub *directly* into Windows XP / 2003 / 2008. The problem is I have two install more versions of Windows and it will become too messy.  \n\nIs it possible to tell Grub to bypass the Windows boot-loader and directly boot Windows XP / 2003 / 2008?  \n\nCheers,  \nAndrej van der Zee   \n"
