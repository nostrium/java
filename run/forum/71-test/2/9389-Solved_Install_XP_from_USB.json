PRESETUP.CMD is used for this purpose.\nIn details- while preparing source, remove \\[unattended\\] section from winnt.sif and place it in a temporary file. Upon start of GUI mode use presetup.cmd to merge the temp file with the unattended section, with $winnt$.inf, found in \\\\windows\\\\system32 folder. Same approach could be used to remove/amend other parameters, which may interfere with the Setup.   \n"
