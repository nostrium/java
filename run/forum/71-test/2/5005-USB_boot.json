      "content": "Hi ixboot :smile: ,  \n\nFirstly can I take this oppertunity to welcome you to Boot-Land:  \n\nThis may not be your best answer as usb Booting is sometimes a bit hit \\\u0026 miss @ the best of times!  \n\nDepending on the BIOS of your computer, you can set the USB stick as a boot device.  \nIf your PC\u0027s BIOS does not seem to support this, **check if there is an update for the available BIOS!\nYour milage may vary :-)**   \nFor some reason most BIOS\u0027es prefer to refer to the thumbdrive as a USB Removable Floppy Disk or USB Zip Disk.  \n\nAlso Google search for a commercial program called **Naslite** it also lets you create a kicker floppy disk to boot from, which then fires up the USB device -- handy for motherboards without a USB-boot option.  \n\nAlso found this as a possible alternative but according to the wording seems experimental  \n\n\u003e What you are referring to already exist (ONLY partially) it is called in jargon \"kicker\".  \n\u003e Basically it is a floppy or CD that contains a program or OS loader that adds to BIOS (temporarily) missing features or that, bypassing the BIOS, gives the possibility to boot from another media or bus otherwise unsupported.  \n\u003e\n\u003e Two typical examples are Smart Boot Manager and BCDL that allow for booting from CD on machines which BIOS does not support CD booting:  \n\u003e [http://btmgr.sourcef...t/download.html](http://btmgr.sourceforge.net/download.html \"External link\")  \n\u003e [http://www.911cd.net...showtopic\u003d18650](http://www.911cd.net/forums//index.php?showtopic\u003d18650 \"External link\")  \n\u003e\n\u003e The ONLY (for the moment) HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL solution for USB is the plop bootmanager, see this:  \n\u003e www.boot-land.net/forums/index.php?showtopic\u003d3226  \n\u003e \u003e Theoretically it should provide from booting from USB devices even on machines which BIOS does not allow it.  \n\u003e \u003e\n\u003e \u003e i.e. it provides internally a USB stack/drivers, so that you do not need (like grub4dos or AFAIK any other bootloader) to rely on BIOS services.  \n\u003e \u003e\n\u003e \u003e jaclaz\n\u003e jaclaz\n\u003e\n\u003e \u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nHope this helps,  \n\nispy :smile:   \n"

      "content": "Hi ixboot :smile: ,  \n\nStill very much in experimental stage you could try this boot manager:  \n\u003e An alternative may be, at least for some operating systems, the newish version of PLOP:  \n\u003e [http://www.plop.at/en/bootmanager.html](http://www.plop.at/en/bootmanager.html \"External link\")  \n\u003e [http://www.plop.at/e...mngrusblog.html](http://www.plop.at/en/bootmngrusblog.html \"External link\")  \n\u003e N.B. still VERY experimental\nIt may provide a solution?  \n\ne.g. for ubuntu the following:  \n**Re: boot into usb?**   \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  \nTo boot Ubuntu from a USB drive.  \nPlop contains support for USB drives.  \nThe Plop boot floppy will boot Grub on the USB drive.  \nYou need to have Grub on the USB drive.  \nThe Ubuntu installation had a Grub entry for HD(1,0).This worked fine when the USB drive was connected to the install system.  \nPlop has the USB drive as HD0. You need to add an entry to Grub for the Plop boot. I used HD(0,0).  \nThe new entry allows Ubuntu to be booted from the USB drive on a system with a bios that has no USB support.  \n\nRegards \\\u0026 Best Wishes,  \n\nispy :smile:   \n"
