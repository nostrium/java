      "content": "\u003e so if it is where do i start from\n\nA good idea would be to start posting in the correct Forum. ![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif)  \n\nThis here is called \"Multiboot\", it seems more appropriate than \"LiveXP \\\u0026 NativeEx\" where you originally posted. ![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif)  \n\nAnyway, WELCOME! ![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif)  \n\nIf I get it right, you want to have a number of different NT based operating systems stored in various \"self-contained\" .ISO files on your hard disk.  \n\nAm I correct? ![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif)  \n\nIf yes:  \n\nShort answer:  \nIt is not possible.  \n\nLong answer:  \nIt is possible, but there are a NUMBER of drawbacks:  \n1) Booting NT based OS from .iso files is ONLY (yet ![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif)) possible using a RAMDISK approach, which needs files from Server 2003 SP1 or R2  \n2) Usually PE (NOT the \"full\" version) of the OS is used, though there is an exception (ETBOOT) that requires, additionally, files from XP embedded   \n3) The OS will be \"Read only\", ANY settings you will change will be reset at reboot  \n4) The procedure to make such a settings is to be considered \"advanced\", and needs a more than basic knowledge of the workings of NT based systems, you will need a lot of patience and time to get it working  \n\nSo, I guess that you should expand a bit on the reasons for which you \"need\" such a setting, there may be other (simpler) ways to fulfill your needs, if this is just \"having several independent booting NT based OS on the same HD\".  \n\n![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif)  \n\njaclaz   \n"

      "content": "Well, this is then an alltogether different question.  \n\nThe latter idea is to have a number of HD images (NOT .ISO ones), saved in a NTFS filesystem as \"sparse\" files (or VMware \"growable\" images), each one having a NT based install on it and booted through a Virtual Machine?  \n\nIf yes, this is not multibooting at all, it\u0027s about using Virtual Machines and is perfectly doable.  \n\nBut of course, you are going to experiment a sensible drop of speed/responsiveness, usually a system in a VM slows down to approximately 1/2 to 1/3 of \"normal\" speed.  \n\njaclaz   \n"
