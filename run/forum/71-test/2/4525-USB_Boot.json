      "content": "Since a while I\u0027m trying successless to boot my WinBuilder result from USB stick  \n\nAfter trying the sticks I have, I thought that they may be rather old and not suited for boot, and I bought a SanDisk Cruzer, which many times is reported as suitable.  \n\nBut I still do not have any success.  \n\nI do not want to tell all the trials I made wit the HP formatting utility, with PE2USB and PEToUSB etc.  \n\nI think that is a HW issue:  \n\nIn the event log there can be found:  \n\nDuring boot:  \n\nOnce:  \n\u003e Der Dienst \"NEC PCI to USB Enhanced Host Controller\" wurde aufgrund folgenden Fehlers nicht gestartet:   \n\u003e Der angegebene Dienst kann nicht gestartet werden.

It is either not activated or bound to not activated devices\n\nAnd only is the stick plugged in (only during boot, never later) I get several errors:  \n\u003e Der Treiber hat einen Controllerfehler auf \\\\Device\\\\Harddisk0\\\\D gefunden.\nEnglish like:  \n\u003e The driver detected a controller failure on \\\\Device\\\\Harddisk0\\\\D\n\nAny opinion what\u0027s going wrong or what I can do?  \n\nPeter   \n"

      "content": "```\nMORE INFORMATION\n\nWhen your computer pages information to or from the disk, if a generic error occurs, it logs an Event ID 51event message. In a paging operation, the operating system either swaps a page of memory from memory to disk or retrieves a page of memory from disk to memory. It is part of the memory management of Microsoft Windows.\n\n\n\nHowever, the computer may log this event message when it loads images from a storage device, reads and writes to locally mapped files or to any file \u0026#40;as long as it is buffered I/O\u0026#41;. The computer does not log this event message when it performs non-buffered I/O. You can troubleshoot an Event ID 51 event message the same way as you troubleshoot Event ID 9 or 11 event messages. \n\n\n\nUnder certain circumstances, the system logs the following event ID 51 event message\u0026#58;\n\n\n\nAn error was detected on device \\Device\\DeviceName during a paging operation\n\nIn this case, no harmful affects are experienced. For example, event ID 51 is logged when blank media such as CDR, CDRW, DVDR, and so on, is inserted into a writable drive while a USB device is plugged in. The system logs the event even though the disc is writable, and the USB device is still usable. In these particular cases, you can safely ignore the log entries, and no additional action is required. \n\n\n\nFor more information, click the following article numbers to view the articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base\u0026#58; \n\n154690 How to troubleshoot event ID 9, event ID 11, and event ID 15 error messages \n\n259237 Troubleshooting event ID 9, 11, and 15 on Cluster Servers \n\nYou can use the binary data that is associated with any \u0026#34;DISK\u0026#34; error \u0026#40;Event ID 7, 9, 11, 51, and others\u0026#41; to assist you in identifying the problem by decoding the data section. For more information about how to decode the data section, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base\u0026#58; \n\n182335 Format of event log data created by ScsiPortLogError \n\n\n\nBack to the top\n\nBecause an Event ID 51 has an additional command descriptor block \u0026#40;CDB\u0026#41; box, you must take into account the following information when you are reviewing the data section of an Event ID 51 event message.\n```\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n"
