      "content": "![:huh:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/huh.png) Ok I have been running in circles. Too many ways of doing the same thing...  \n\nI am trying to create an all-in-one repair support flash drive on an 8GB flash drive (SanDisk Cruzer). Since it is easier to update a flash drive than a cd/iso.   \nI am trying to create a simple boot menu to select programs (Aero Studio, GRUB4DOS ![:huh:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/huh.png))... Later I will need to consolidate some of the programs (remove doubles/overlaps). Only using 1 partition and not looking for Win installers.  \n\nI am trying to incorporate the following:  \n\nUBCD4Win (XP only? or similar program)  \nVista PE (works with both XP and Vista?)  \nUBCD (v 4.1.1)  \nBack Track (v 3)  \nKNOPPIX (5.3.1)\n\nSuggestions are greatly appreciated.   \n"

I would still have to script some of the programs in. The menu system can be better. I worked with AeroStudio and the syslinux.cfg file. I also don\u0027t need the Win installers.   \n"
