I\u0027ve tried Easyboot but it doesn\u0027t play nice with linux; linux doesnt finish loading. Would it be possible for me to make a boot disc using bcdw2 booting the linux of an iso ?

      "content": "Guys, I am creating a multiboot disk that has the Windows sever 2003 install and a live linux. The problem I am having is that when I create the ISO (using Magic ISO) I am given options for Rockridge , Joliet or ISO16690?? (you get the point). Anywho, when I create the Iso using the ISO1660 Windows works but Linux doesn\u0027t. Conversely , when I use Rockridge, linux works but windows doesn\u0027t. Does anyone know of any settings or ISO creation apps that I can use to make an ISO that is both windows an linux friendly for this multiboot project?  \n\nThank you  \nNytechman   \nNYC   \n\n\"Every complexity has it\u0027s orgins in Simpliclity\"   \n"

Each version may require different solution.  \n\nThere are two approaches:  \n\n1) use filesystem ISO9660 and Joliet:  \ne.g. Knoppix find image at Joliet or Rock Ridge file system.  \nJoliet is limited in file name lenth, but should match current requirements 2003 install and linux.  \n\n2) use filesystem ISO9660 and Rock Ridge:  \nXP, 2003 boot sector file dosn\u0027t like Rock Ridge.   \nUse a appropiate bootloader. Use a bootloader to load setupldr.bin directly.  \nE.g. BCDW or grub4dos.   \n"
