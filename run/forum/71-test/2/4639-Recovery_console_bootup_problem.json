      "content": "Hello everybody.  \nI have a pc with three os installed: vista, xp and another virgin copy of xp which i use for testing purposes.  \nThe \"virgin xp\" copy is on primary partition C:, the other copy of xp stays on primary partition D:, while vista resides in logical partition E:  \nAt boot time it starts the vista bootloader, with 2 voices, \"Windows xp\" and \"Windows Vista\"; when you select the voice \"Windows Xp\", it loads the classic black xp bootscreen, where in my case you have 2 other voices, one for the xp installed in C:, the other for the xp installed in D:  \nUp to here everything is regular. Anyway, I have recently installed the xp emergency recovery console (using the command  \n\\[xp cd rom drive letter\\]:\\\\i386\\\\winnt32.exe /cmdcons /unattend), but the problem is that the voice \"emergency recovery console\" has added both in vista bootloader screen, and the next screen with the boot voices for the other 2 copies of xp.  \nMy question is: is it possible to cancel a voice from the xp bootup screen but mantain it in vista bootloader? Because if i cancel the recovery console voice from boot.ini, it also disappears from vista bootloader screen(and if i use \";\" before that voice, it disappears from vista bootloader but not xp bootup screen)...  \nShould I modify the ntldr file? What should I do?  \n\nPractically, the real problem is:  \n1 a duplicate voice it\u0027s of true no use for me  \n2 even if it were useful, it doesn\u0027t actually work! If I select the recovery console voice from vista bootloader screen, everything works happily, while if I select the one from xp bootup screen it crashes into this error: \"a disk read error occurred. press ctrl+alt+del to restart\" (is the error due to the fact that xp bootloader looks for the recovery console bootup files in the wrong drive?)  \nplease help  \nmany thanks   \n"

      "content": "i begin with replying to all of your considerations, then finish with writing the answer to the question of what happens if you put another copy of grldr and menu.lst on second partition D:.  \n\nfirst and foremost i\u0027m sorry but i don\u0027t know what entries BCD file has (i think they are the ones listed in the bcdedit command line result, aren\u0027t they?), anyway i\u0027d expect bootmgr to stay on C:, and in fact there it is. The same holds true for ntldr. Winload.exe stays on partition E: (in Vista OS folder).  \nBut yes, i guess drives lettering is in some way messed up...  \ni don\u0027t have any duplicated ntldr nor boot.ini files, this i checked on all drives, but i can tell you something interesting about drives lettering being messed up: i previously said bootmgr is in drive C:. But well, drive C: when i am on xp. vista actually sees the drives letters fairly in a different manner from what the remaining two xp OSes do; while in both the two xp OSes you see C: as the virgin xp partition, D: as the partition for the xp copy i normally use, and E: for the partition where vista resides in, inside vista you see C: as the partition that the others OSes see as E: (C: is the vista OS partition), D: as the partition that the others see as C: (so the virgin xp partition), F: as the partition that the others see as D: (the usual-xp one)   \n(E: is another partition we can here ignore because it only contains data: anyway under xp it is seen as F:).  \nI have posted two screenshots to let you analyze what you see both in vista and xp (two images sometimes speak better than any other million words). I believe they can help understanding the situation, since you can also take a look at which are considered the active, logical, extendend or primary partitions by one OS or the other.  \nBefore to proceed just an important specifying: from now on, to avoid confusion, i will refer to the drives as seen by xp. In fact i think even if vista sees it as D:, it is on the partition seen by xp as C:, that i think it resides the MBR, C: which i also think is the active partition (maybe i\u0027m wrong). So the virgin xp copy will be \"xp1\" on C:, the usual-xp copy will be \"xp2\" on D:, the vista copy will be \"vista\" on E:  \nWe can now proceed summing up:  \nwhen you say   \n\u003e It seems like BCD has entries for:  \n\u003e BOOTMGR on D: (Second Partition)  \n\u003e NTLDR on D: (Second Partition)  \n\u003e WINLOAD.EXE on C: (First Partition)\nin my way of understanding you are right only if you consider drives letters as seen by vista (because in the interpretation of drives letters as seen by xp, bcd should instead have an entry for bootmgr on C:, to work, not on D:, and so on for the other files). Besides, it surely is possible that i have (the same) \\\\CMDCONS seen differently when booted in XP or booted in vista, but in the locution \"(seen) as D:\\\\CMDCONS when booted in XP and as C:\\\\CMDCONS when booted in Vista\"\n\"D:\" should mean \u0027D:-as-seen-by-xp\u0027, and \"C:\" mean \u0027C:-as-seen-by-xp\u0027. In fact, given that cmdcons folder resides on C: (please remember that C: in my view is where xp1 resides), it should throw out the error because cmdcons is loaded by ntldr from D:, while it is on C:. In this way your sentence works: sorry to be a fussy man, but i think we must first share a common view to be sure to cooperate successfully. Maybe mine is wrong, but i have to correct mine first. Anyway i hope to have been clear enough in my explanation, but just hope.  \nIn conclusion, to answer an important question. If you mean D: as \u0027D:-as-seen-by-xp\u0027 (like i said i will do from now on), the action to put another copy of grldr and menu.lst on D: has produced no result. On the contrary, if i cut and paste grldr and menu.lst to D: (deleting them from C: -- C: is once again where xp1 resides), and then if i edit the boot.ini line not to be C:\\\\grldr\u003d\"Grub4dos\", but D:\\\\grldr\u003d\"Grub4dos\", the result is that the choice for grub disappears from vista bootloader, and when i load it from the xp following screen, it gives an error (hal.dll missing, don\u0027t know why).  \n\nAny further idea for a solution?  \nthank you very much indeed..  \n\nps: i please ask you too to adopt my convention to indicate partitions. C: is \u0027C:-as-seen-by-xp\u0027 and so on.  \n\n#### Attached Thumbnails {#attach_wrap}\n\n* [![gestione_disco_xp.JPG](http://reboot.pro/uploads/monthly_05_2008/post-15106-1210573947_thumb.jpg)](http://reboot.pro/uploads/monthly_05_2008/post-15106-1210573947.jpg \"gestione_disco_xp.JPG - Size: 107.76KB\"){#ipb-attach-url-5326-0-07684300-1676066746}\n* [![gestione_disco_vista.jpg](http://reboot.pro/uploads/monthly_05_2008/post-15106-1210573965_thumb.jpg)](http://reboot.pro/uploads/monthly_05_2008/post-15106-1210573965.jpg \"gestione_disco_vista.jpg - Size: 116.27KB\"){#ipb-attach-url-5327-0-07692900-1676066746}\n\n"

      "content": "i\u0027m back again..  \nwell, i have to admit i would have been very glad to solve the problem without re-installing everything. i had a lot of stuff saved on both OSes xp and vista, and a lot of updates done. i would have posted all the errors (figure out that there was all the times a different message for every single change in configuration), and would have find a solution anyhow, since it is a pity all this waste of space and time on a forum. anyway i do really thank you, for all the clarifications (also on the MBR ![:lol:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/laugh.png) ). you have been kind and quick in answers, which is difficult to find elsewhere: it induces one to consider this a good and welcoming forum, a nice place where to request, and maybe also give, help.  \nbut unfortunately, after having installed sp3 on windows xp, the xp OS didn\u0027t boot up anymore at all. i just wanted to throw my pc out of the window (out of the Windows™!), that\u0027s to say this has contributed to make me decide to format and re-partition the physical drive once and for all. i now have just Windows xp, and the console perfectly works. i will virtualize any other OS to install, i had experienced (Xp-rienced) too many problems with multibooting OSes, and this also in other occasions.  \nGoddamn\u0027it!  \n\nThank you again the same.  \nCiao!   \n"
