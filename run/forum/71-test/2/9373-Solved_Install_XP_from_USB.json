      "content": "This truly is a great utility and I\u0027ve gotten close to completing the install. I have 3 questions that I can\u0027t seem to figure out...   \n\n1) I understand how to package up the Mass Storage drivers and slip them in BartPE but I thought our \"Give XP Setup Source Path \u003d \\[\\]\" should point to the setup files of xp and not the setup files for BartPE? I\u0027ve tried the Integrator tool but I couldn\u0027t figure out how your drivers slip into that tool(how that whole thing works).   \n\n2) My main goal is to use my puppy Linux derivative. I can\u0027t seem seem to boot from it at all... I have tried various versions of puppy linux and it keeps erroring out saying the it could not find the pup.sfs files. I don\u0027t have the exact error message as I\u0027m reinstalling this USB drive, but I\u0027ll post the message when it completes. I have placed all the files on the root of the usb drive. I\u0027m thinking maybe it\u0027s because it\u0027s formatted in NTFS?   \n\n3) Do I need to create 2 partitions on the usb drive to have UBCD4WIN if i have BartPE as the main?  \n\nOn a side note, I want to say thank you, because this is something I\u0027ve been wanting to do for a loooooong time.  \n\nThanks,  \n\n- Christian   \n"

I have an USB HDD logical partition NTFS with puppy inside booting.  \nMy grub4dos menu.lst entry is (I change the location and name of kernel/initrd, you can easily modify to your need):  \n\n```\ntitle Puppy Linux 3.1\n\nfind --set-root /images/puppyk\n\nkernel /images/puppyk root\u003d/dev/ram0 initrd\u003dpuinitrd.gz PMEDIA\u003dusbflash\n\ninitrd /images/puinitrd.gz\n```\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nThe pup_301.sfs and zdrv_301.sfs files are to be put at the root of the corresponding partition.   \n"

In that case BartPE and UBCD4WIN can easily coexist on the same partition of your USB-stick.  \n[http://www.boot-land...?showtopic\u003d5306](http://www.boot-land.net/forums/?showtopic\u003d5306 \"External link\")  \n\nwimb   \n"
