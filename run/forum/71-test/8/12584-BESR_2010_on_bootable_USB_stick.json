      "content": "Thank you Wonko for informing the community about those acronyms and products, you are 100% correct, point well taken.  \n\nSo, hereby a description of my actions in trying to get a bootable USB:  \n\n° The guidelines that i used are:  \n[http://www.symantec....usb-version-srd](http://www.symantec.com/connect/forums/creating-bootable-usb-version-srd \"External link\")  \n\n° For the diskpart section, i followed the guideline step by step. Nothing special to report here.   \n\n° For the next section; where you have to copy all the files from the SRD CD, you have two options.  \n\n° Option 1: copy all files from an original SRD CD. The ISO for this CD can be downloaded (free) from Symantec (you only need to make an account for the download in Trial section).   \n\n° ISO used was the 9.0.1.36527_English_Recovery_Disk_Only.iso. This is a bootable, not customized UK SRD CD. I burned it to a CD and indeed the CD itself booted and worked as it should be.  \n\n° Copied all folders and files from this CD to the USB.  \n\n° When booting with this stick in port, nothing happens. To say Win 7 is booting as always from my C: drive. No errors from the stick, no booting from the stick. As if there\u0027s no stick in the USB port.  \n\n° Option 2: copy all files from a customized SRD CD. Therefore you have to start from the installed BESR 2010 software on your system. In BESR you have an option to build a customized SRD CD. As a result you get a customized ISO, with some changes in config files and added or removed drivers (like for HDD raid, NIC drivers, etc...).  \n\n° Booting this stick gave same results as option 1. Meaning no boot from the USB and no errors reported. Win 7 started from my C: drive.  \n\nFound a slightly different guideline:  \n[http://98.129.119.16...usb-flash-drive](http://98.129.119.162/connect/fr/articles/techtip-installing-symantec-recovery-disk-srd-usb-flash-drive \"External link\")  \n\nTried also this way, but same results as above.  \n\nStatement: we can exclude the stick itself and the BIOS settings (boot order) on my computer! Why?  \n\nBecause i also made a bootable USB version for Snapshot (German backup software) with the same stick, on the same computer. According to the guidelines from Snapshot found at: [http://www.drivesnap.../en/bootusb.htm](http://www.drivesnapshot.de/en/bootusb.htm \"External link\")  \n\n° In Step 1 i also used the same diskpart method as above (same as for the SRD software).   \n\n° Step 2 until 4 executed as written in the guideline.   \n\n° Booting with this USB stick worked perfectly and I was able to run the Snapshot software from stick.  \n\nSo the method or BESR / SRD software from Symantec for USB use, is not working. Although there SRD CD\u0027s are always booting and working fine for me. But alas, i need an USB option as well.  \n\nStructure ISO\u0027s:  \n\nFolders (root only):  \n\nBIN  \nBOOT  \nDDB  \nDOCS  \nDRIVER VALIDATION  \nEFI  \nMANAGER  \nSOURCES  \nSUPPORT  \n\nFiles (root only):  \n\nAUTORUN.INF  \nBOOTMGR  \nBROWSER.EXE  \nBROWSER.ICO  \nBROWSER.INI  \nSHLWAPI.DLL  \nSYMDRIVERINFO.XML  \nSYMINFO.XML  \nUNICOWS.DLL  \n\nAny ideas guys?  \n\nMac   \n"

      "content": "\u003e I have posted my screenshots on my website in a small tutorial. Can you reproduce these steps with same ISO?\n\nWell, i didn\u0027t found that tutorial or the qUSBtest on your site.  \nSo I went for the BIOS settings as second option.   \n\nDisabled the HDD (WD VelociRaptor) by setting Auto (at HDD Auto-Detection settings) to None.   \nBoot device priority was   \n1. CDROM  \n2. USB-HDD  \n3. HDD  \n\nReboot PC and the USB stick was booting!  \nMmmmm, i was not happy.  \nBack to BIOS and reset None to Auto.  \nReboot PC and stick was still booting (yes!)  \n\nI was happy (but for short)  \nRestarted Win 7 and restarted after that.  \nStick no longer booted ;(  \nMmmm, wth?  \n\nBack to BIOS and checked Hard Disk Boot priority settings this time.  \nHey, things have changed here!?  \nSeems, the USB stick is no longer first but last in the list.   \nI clearly remember setting the USB stick first on the list 3 weeks ago.  \nAfter more testing I found that when the HDD booted to win 7, the HDD boot priority settings in the BIOS where changed. (is this normal?)  \n\nSo, I have a solution for my problem.  \nWhen I need to boot the USB stick, I have to go (each time) into the BIOS and reset the USB stick to the first HDD in line. The F12 button when booting does not help me, it\u0027s only to set the device priority among the devices and that doesn\u0027t seems the problem here.  \n\nQuestion remaining: is it normal that the HDD priority list is changing depending on who started last time first? BTW, never seen any comment on this behaviour before, maybe some guideline should refer to this scenario!  \n\nThank you Steve, you set me to of to find the solution.  \n\nP.S.

Switch off, switch on - BIOS still boots to pen AAA  \n5.
