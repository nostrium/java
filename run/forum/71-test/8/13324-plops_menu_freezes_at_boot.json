      "content": "Hello,   \n\nI am running Windows XP. I can\u0027t boot directly from USB so I need a floppy disk to to the trick. I used Plop boot manager for this. I opened plpbt.img with WinImage and wrote the plpbt.bin into A:\\\\ . I formated my usb stick in fat32, placed Linux Mint on it and restarted my pc. At boot screen, i selected to boot from floppy, it booted, it showed me the plop menu, i selected USB and it freezed. What seems to be the problem ? Do I have another alternative ? Thanks.   \n"
