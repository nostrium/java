      "content": "Hey Guys,  \n\nI\u0027ve been searching around for some hours how to boot KNOPPIX with GRUB4DOS. I found a working solution some time ago, but cannot find it anymore. Can someone tell me how to boot KNOPPIX with grub4dos?  \n\nI think there\u0027s no working solution for directly booting the iso-File but to boot with the three files linux, minirt.gz and KNOPPIX.  \n\nThank You  \nPatrick   \n"

      "content": "I get the impression that what you actually meant was, \"boot **Knoppix** from an **.ISO** file.\" While you can certainly emulate an ODD (optical disc drive) with **GRUB4DOS** and an .ISO file, you\u0027d have to be certain that your OS is capable of booting from an .ISO file. That is, the OS would have to support scanning your attached disks for the .ISO file, mounting it as a loop-back device, then continuing as though it had been booted from OD. ~~I don\u0027t believe that Knoppix supports this, but could be mistaken.~~ See Icecube\u0027s post, below!  \n\nGRUB4DOS hooks **BIOS INT 13h** services to emulate an ODD.  \n\nOperating systems that do not use INT 13h (such as Windows and Linux) will not have access to such an emulated ODD; they have to use some other means to find and use the .ISO file.   \n"
