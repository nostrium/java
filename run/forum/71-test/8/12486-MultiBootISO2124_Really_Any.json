      "content": "Ok, lets see how this post goes.  \n\nSooo....  \n\nawhile back i went rounds with the previous MBI 176 and 212 trying to get it work as a multiboot option and low and behold its not quite true without some tweaking on a few ISO\u0027s (and Images), Bitdefender, balder and one other I tried needed tweaking. Bitdefender is still open in this Forum.  \n\nI\u0027d imagine with all the new and latest tweaker twitters everyone has moved on to more popular trend venues.   \n\nAnyhow, this is if any mainly for reference and I would guess the answer will show up somewhere.  \n\nThe new 2.1.2.4 renamed my Boot hard drive, nice touch with the whole unplug and replug while the USB is still accessing and never stopped until I did unplug it thing... really needs some major adjustment!   \n\nThat is not normal to me. I think it could use a seperate function and force the program to CLOSE, and manual re-open, would be a good end of that story.  \n\nNow, version 212 of MBI came with an updated support for PM which ever version it was. No problem, renamed the zip and MBI happily obliged and created the correct entries, even tho it was the wrong version ISO.   \n\n5.4 pm came out and went with a newer update as did MBI 2124. But MBI 2124 is only up to supporting 5.4. Well, I put my turlte to work and downloaded 5.5 to try. Its still giving me issue even with Unet. Sooo... I did some toying and menu editing trying 0xf and hd32 plus renaming and retrying different file names to no avail.  \n\nIt comes up with an error about --0 head sector error 62.  \n\nIs is possible to get the right settings or should I just go back to using pm 5.3 edited to coincide with MBI 212  \n\nblah blah blah... any ways. I hope this helps.   \n\nOne thing I dont understand is I read the documentation on PM home site. It states that PM dont care how it is on your thumbdrive/flashdrive as long as the directory allocation is correct and what ever support files it needs.  \n\nSo much for point and click. I see after digging further into MBI it uses Fbinst. It went through my mind about learning how to run it. In the long run, I could have saved a few weeks and been a little further along.   \n\nThe thing that aches me is why the hell MBI\u0027s support is such a pain with some items. And not to nag, but why is neccessary for MBI to only support the zip? If someone really cant figure out a zip/compressed file what are they doing trying to use a Partition/Imaging software to begin with?  \n\nThanx for your time. When MBI works, it does work well. Unetbootin.. well, It works too when it has too ![:hyper:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/hyper.gif)  \n\nI guess I will give the manual USB install via PM\u0027s website a trial. I was hopin to use up that all that spare space on one flashdrive with a multiboot option.  \n\n- Z   \n"

      "content": "WYUSIWUG   \n\nThanx for translating Icecube!  \n\nHey ya wonko! I think you need a change in diet...  \n\nI usually do some short forming like; MBI (MultibootISO) as well as Parted Magic (PM) which you find is named in its LZ compressed and zipped extension as pmagicXX.   \n\nI re-found some info about PMagic, that it has a simple way of installing new programs you add to the Live CD. Simply drop the new package in the live folder directory and it automatically installs them at boot ![:hyper:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/hyper.gif)  \n\nSorry, I didn\u0027t mean to ruffle your feathers you big wonk :smile:   \n\nNow, if I could just find a way to type much less and not have to use a mouse at all!  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nc/o:  \n[http://partedmagic.c...g-programs.html](http://partedmagic.com/documentation/122-adding-programs.html \"External link\")  \nParted Magic is not exactly Slackware based, but the main tool chain was compiled on Slackware. \\*shrug\\*   \n\nIf you are using the USB version the packages can be simply copied to /pmagic/pmodules. Pmagic will automatically load this directory everytime, simplifying custom package loading. But then it seems contradictory in going on to say that you may, or do, need to remaster the iso... nevermind. I think the ending spells it out better... it just depends on how you have it loaded to your (in my case) Thumbdrive  \n\nor.... Pendrive, Flashdrive. I mean USB Flashdrive Memory device.  \n\ncontinuing.....  \n\nIf you would like to add programs your best bet is to use TGZ packages from Slackware 13.x. You can also use DEB files, but Parted Magic doesn\u0027t make any attempt to resolve dependencies.   \n\nIntall XZ for Linux if your distro doesn\u0027t already have it. The txz archives allow for a file format that easily works with Parted Magic.   \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nFor this example we will make a txz module for cramfs. Create a directory that will be the mock /usr.  \n\nmkdir -p fake_usr/sbin  \ncp /sbin/mkcramfs fake_usr/sbin  \ncd fake_usr  \ntar cvJf ../cramfs.txz \\*   \n\nAnd it also states again that these packages are automatically loaded...  \n\nNow copy the cramfs.txz package to the pmodules directory on the Parted Magic media. Obviously if you\u0027re using the LiveCD the iso must be remastered and reburned. Using the USB version you can just copy it to the pmodules directory. Parted Magic automatically unloads all \\*txz packages in pmodules, so no further configuration is needed.   \n\nWhat was the point of this input? \\*shrug\\*  \n\nDid i mention how well it was put together for the un-intelligible Tech head? That don\u0027t like rodents?  \n\nBTW wonk, did you get your hug today :smile:  \n\n- Z   \n"

IE8 saves the password anyways no matter what. go figure. It must be something to do with certain other browsers? I guess it should say; don\u0027t forget to clear your cachee upon exit. But of course in stock format IE8 wont clear them anyways when you tell it to ![:(](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/sad.png)  \n\nBack on the subject of MBI (Multibootpiso), I seem to have an issue trying to test out the Partition Wizard Home Edition 5.2   \nversion (PWHE). Which must be affectionately re-named pwhe5.iso to work with MultiBootISO.  \n\nI tried a couple simple edits to the ISO name and the \"Menu.lst\". Menu.lst is part of the Grub Loader that has the Grub loader menu tiles, file names, and basic load settings which is made to edit and thus load your own ISO\u0027s. However, PWHE would not load until I tried 2.1.2.4 which was not all that kind at first as it renamed my computers Boot Drive, something that should reeeaaallly be re-handled.  \n\nAnyone know of an editor for the meek that shows the file structure or under lying elements on a USB flashdrive? I know I had a few and one was all I needed. It was a disk/hex editor. I dont think it was HXD tho (Hex Editor) but my guess is it will do the same...  \n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*  \n\nI tried a few more options last nite on \"Partition Magic\" version 5.5 to no avail. I am going to try and re-download the ISO   \nand see if that makes any difference, doubt it. Its something to do with this whole interface structure. Its a hit and miss at times. I can take the same ISO, make it work once, not work the next, then loads the next. A simple file structure change on the Flashdrive will break this operation. Memtest and Dban seem rather unaffected 99.999999%. Its easily understood   \nbecause they are such a small structure. But then again, I can load a GIG of files into memory and run them all from there   \nwithout any seemingly issue for hours. \\*sigh\\*  \n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*  \n\nThe Partition Magic website\u0027s homepage states that PM does not care one bit if you add it to your drive with other files   \nalready on it. If I remember correctly its says something about not being in ISO form, you must extract all files and drop   \nthe two main folders at the root and what ever is suppose to be done from there. Is this stating or am I understanding this   \ncorrectly that in ISO format it will complain? Load it, parse it, search it, load it, right? But not for ISO? Or not for flash memory ?  \n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*  \n\nI know Unetbootin could not handle pm5.5 either and between MBI and Unet they both come up with about 3-5 different   \ncomplaints about something and are, in my opinion, attributed to (ahem) simple load handling. Sometimes, it sees as though the ISO/Files do not copy in the order that the loader is looking for, period.   \n\n2 brand new, 2 different brand flashdrives, 4gb each. Formatted them a couple times now, I don\u0027t think this matters one Iota past the stock format even using something as simple as XP. Right click the drive, format, later, quick format, done.  \n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*  \n\nThe only time it would seem to matter to format would be is if ONE you can\u0027t seem to see the drive and do not want to hex   \nedit it/repair it. TWO you want to drop a raw.iso on the root and need some other files to help boot it like with which MBI   \nor Unet do (bootstrap assistance) which is thus termed a Bootable Formatting. Thirdly, if you just wanted to do a quick   \nformat its simply erases the MFT (Master Files Table). Does this make much difference on a Flashdevice? Can a quick format be trusted? Is this not \u0027near\u0027 the same as simply deleting all file structure at the root anyways? Its either working or it is not and if its not t-h-e-n you would need a format!  \n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*  \n\nIf MBI loads v.x.iso just fine with b1 and b2 settings, you would figure it would not or should not complain when you rename v.5 to v.x and use the same b1 b2 settings. I\u0027m still scratching my head to figure that out since all the other files that MBI loads for Syslinux are the same damn ones!  \n\nOk, so in Menu.lst, you open it up, it says this:  \n\n# Suggested by Deb (note that I\u0027ve adjusted this one more then once to make it work)  \ntitle Partition Wizard 5 (Partition Tools)  \nfind --set-root /pwhe5.iso  \nmap /pwhe5.iso (hd32)  \nmap --hook  \nroot (hd32)  \nchainloader (hd32)  \n\n# This one is a real stickler for file handling/naming. When it decides to work it works quite well.  \n# notice that the names are different between the title and the .iso name. The only part that should   \n# matter and matter is does.   \ntitle Parted Magic 5.1 (Partition Tools)  \nfind --set-root /pmagic-5.2.iso  \nmap /pmagic-5.2.iso (hd32)  \nmap --hook  \nroot (hd32)  \nconfigfile /boot/grub/grub4dos.lst  \n\nThe other files alloted to the flashdrives ROOT (root meaning the base of a drive or directory (folder), are:  \n\n- splash.xpm.gz  \n- grub.exe  \n- syslinux.cfg  \n- liveusb  \n- menu.lst //Of course this will change each time the MBI loads this  \n- ldlinux.sys //the date changes when its loaded but does the programming?  \n\n- And two text files that God only knows might wreak havoc if I should delete them and one day a major need arises to use this and it decides to verify the SHA hash of the non-exsistent readme file while its shuffling pertinent life saving   \ninformation that makes no difference whats in that file anyways. \\*rolls eyes\\* sorry, off on a tangent...  \n\nThe only two that change, or have in some time that make any difference are the \"Menu.lst\" and the \"ldlinux.sys\".  \n\nThe one I think thats causing the issue is the ldlinux but I don\u0027t speak or eat greek :tongue:  \n\nPW5.2 will load as long as its renamed and edited like you see here. I dont care if its been chewed on by the dog but Memtest and Dban are the same way. They just work. But I do suggest a known good working copy ![:(](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/sad.png)  \n\nThe old 1.7.6 MBI was interesting, really all one needed to do was drop the ISO or files in the pre-made MBI directories on   \nyour drive, if any at the root and MBI just loaded em up :wink:   \n\nMenu.lst changelog.... be nice to see those too.  \n\nGiving credit where credit is due.... did i mention I hate typing as much as reading?  \n\n- Z  \n\nhey Wonk... ps, I like greek sushi tho :wink:  \n\npss... this boards editor engine really needs some tweaks.   \n"

Eventually trying to figure out how to use the Recovery Console from the UFD as well.   \n\nThe system has XP SP3 installed. The original cd I have only has SP1 and you cannot install the Recovery Console to the hard drive if the system has been updated past XP SP2. \\*rolls eyes\\*.  \n\nI\u0027ve never tried nor researched whether there exists a SP3 Recovery Console install and this was owned by a \"tech\" and I guess he never knew about installing the Recovery Console to the drive.  \n\nI\u0027ve come across an item that I\u0027ve yet to try which is a 7mb Recovery Console in ISO format and I need to backtrack and find al the links and menu.lst entries I guess for that too. I guess thats the next thing on the list to decipher as well.   \n\nBut technically speaking, if its easy enough to just drop XP w-sp3 ISO onto the UFD and run it... then my recovery console option will be there in my pocket as well, and the smaller RC.iso as a backup ![\u003c_\u003c](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/dry.png)  \n\nI had been toying with Parted Magic before it got tossed... it really hosed up a working drive and then some and PM or its tools wouldn\u0027t figure out how to correct it either. The \"round to cylinders thing\" was one item that fubar\u0027d it. Thats one item that needs some kind of input and warning when using Pmagic as its on by default.  \n\nI\u0027ve looked at several plus \"How To\u0027s\" on using Pmagic, not a one of them speaks a wink about this \"Round To Cylinders\" option and most miss some critical points on the reviews or intro\u0027s. Anyways... I am off for some food.  \n\n...Thanx for the shared info! I guess I will try and decipher and recompile the info as there is alot in those links.   \n"
