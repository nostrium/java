      "content": "Sorry if this has been asked, but I did not see this particular version of this question asked in the forums, although I could have missed it.  \n\nI am looking to create a multiboot USB where I can boot to and install multiple versions of Windows XP (i.e. Home SP1 \\\u0026 SP3, Pro SP1 \\\u0026 SP3, MCE SP1 \\\u0026 MCE SP3) and some additional ISO\u0027s that are linux based (i.e. gparted, Ophcrack ect). So no know asks, yes the redundancy is necessary, SP2 and up keys were changed, and any OEM sticker on a computer with a blue background (SP0/SP1) won\u0027t install with an SP2/SP3 disk.   \n\nAs far as I can tell this has a couple problems:  \n\n1) I can use syslinux and load the ISO\u0027s but this requires a FAT32 file system which is quite slow on the read/write, esp with multiple files. I am also getting an error with this, but I think I may have learned what the problem is here. I could extract and chainload the the install, but I think that there is a problem with not having the install files in the root dir of the drive, which can\u0027t happen with 6 versions of the same OS.  \n\n2) All the tutorials I find that allow for NTFS FS assume a single copy of Windows (i.e. Home SP3) with no way to add a additional version, and aren\u0027t MultiBoot  \n\nCurrently I have a working version loading everything I need except the Windows installers with a neat tool from [here](http://www.pendrivelinux.com/boot-multiple-iso-from-usb-multiboot-usb/ \"External link\").   \n\nMy ideal solution would be extracting the ISO\u0027s and loading them from a directory on the drive (/Windows_Installers/WinXP_Home_SP1/) To allow me to slipstream additional drivers, patches, and software on-the-fly, but I can just as well unpack and repack an ISO, just not in the field.  \n\nAnyone have a suggestion? Something I missed? The FS does matter as I am trying to reduce the amount of time I spend in front of the unit restoring.  \n\nThanks in advance.   \n\n**Edited by darkman738, 09 November 2010 - 12:40 AM.**\n"
