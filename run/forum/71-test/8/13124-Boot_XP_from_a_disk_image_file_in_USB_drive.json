      "content": "If you are planning on only booting one model of computer, this is fairly possible, I do believe.  \n\nIf you are planning on booting multiple models, it might be tricker.  \n\nA driver like **WinVBlock** or **Firadisk** will need to find the sector range/image file for the virtual disk on some backing store. That means that the backing store (your USB storage) must be installed and available when our virtual disk driver goes looking for it. This could mean **CriticalDeviceDatabase** entries for USB controllers for all of your targeted computer models.  \n\nIf, however, you are only interested in a single model, you can simply ensure that all of the system\u0027s USB controllers are installed before you capture the image. Then you follow the various guides floating around here concerning adding USB boot-time funtionality to your Windows XP image.   \n"
