If you think this is because of missing pages or etc, than you are truely missing a biiiiiiiiiig point which have nothing to discuss at current topic.  \n\nSimple Internet Reality is: If something is really good, than don\u0027t worry, people on internet will find you even if you write in None-English on a None-English website with a simple post topic. (None-English\u003dRussian, Chinese, Japanese, Taiwan, .... even Turkish :smile:)  \n\nSo far increasing number of people come and find LiveXP, and made tutorials on their webpages etc.  \n\nPlease do NOT change the subject from Hiren to LiveXP. As I wrote **I NEVER write LiveXP as an alternative** neither to Hiren, nor to BartPE, UBCD, UBCDWin, BartPE, Sherpya-XPE .... If a user ask me \"how to obtain a quick rescue cd\", I would advice UBCDwin , UBCD and Hiren.  \n\nIf a user **have time** , than I would also advice learn LiveXP ![:rofl:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/roll1.gif) which I am sure (s)he will spend very good time ![:huh:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/huh.png)   \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n**Going back to subject of the topic:**   \nAs far as I remember, Hiren did not advertise himself through topics all over net etc. Instruction on its webpage is basic level of writing cd, creating ufd bootable and ingredients. (LiveXP do not need cd write tutorial since it has imgburn inside which executes at the end asking to write cd + we have more proper methods \\\u0026 tutorial to make bootable ufd on boot-land (ps: I always avoid making a script to prevent user blow up their ufd, following tutorials and tools of boot-land is already more proper \\\u0026 secure) + Ingredient of LiveXP always available [http://livexp.boot-land.net](http://livexp.boot-land.net \"External link\") )  \n\nHiren do not have tutorials to instruct end user how to use the tools inside etc.  \n\nHiren become more and more popular through years, hence there are lots of instructions and tutorials on multilanguage forums around the world. Reason is simple, Hiren is **very good** for a set of reasons. (I also do not like people asking things about Hiren on boot-land, not because it is warez, If they could use google they could already find answers for their questions, only some lazy guys come around time to time)  \n\nThis is not about Hiren only being Warez. There are lots of WAREZ distributions around with name Dark, Super, Hyper etc... and NONE of them is as famous as Hiren.  \nHere jaclaz made a good instruction about finding warez. [http://www.boot-land...showtopic\u003d10984](http://www.boot-land.net/forums/index.php?showtopic\u003d10984 \"External link\")  \nBut even jaclaz did not say writing \"Hiren\" on google is a way of finding warez :smile: .  \nIt is the name \"Hiren\", noooooooo. It is simple, Hiren is **very good** . If Hiren initially had a name \"Tomatho\" it will again will be as popular as today.  \n\nBartPE, UBCDWIN, Reatogo and SherpyaXPE are **very good** legit alternatives, Hence you can find lots of instructions and tutorials on multilanguage forums all around the world.  \nThere are lots personal pebuilder plugin (\u003dBartPE, UBCDWIN, Reatogo and SherpyaXPE) pages (legit \\\u0026 unlegit) that distributes a loooot of nice stuff.  \nThere are forums dedicated these plugins hence well organised, like the one on 911 [http://www.911cd.net...hp?showforum\u003d30](http://www.911cd.net/forums//index.php?showforum\u003d30 \"External link\")  \nEven today new projects based on pebuilder being created like [TeutonPE](http://www.boot-land.net/forums/index.php?showtopic\u003d10812 \"External link\"),  \nand I do not think Bart Lagerweij himself work on all these stuff himself. :smile:   \n\nSimple fact, pebuilder is **very good** .  \n\nAnd if something is **very good** , do not worry, people come and find you, hence make tutorials, instructions, contributions etc. etc.  \n\nComparing: To me LiveXP getting better and better, hence being more popular slowly with Galapo\u0027s great wisdom. Besides I do not care how much popularity (or well known) it has. LiveXP will NATURALLY get more popular with the continuation of its progress. I do not care when (or if) it will happen or if it can have a degree to get comparable level to above distributions. Life goes and we will see. Basicly The day LiveXP becomes **very good** from all level of end user, than it will, if not than who cares, but it will still have lovers on some level ![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif) .  \n\nI know my post will %95 not be replied properly as usual, for end words:  \nI highly respect success of at most BartPE (and Bart Lagerweij for his wisdom), than SherpyaXP, Reatogo, UBCD, UBCDWin and Hiren. Anyone who have a goal to make something popular should **understand** the reason behind their success. ![:rofl:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/roll1.gif)   \n"

If you think this is because of missing pages or etc, than you are truely missing a biiiiiiiiiig point which have nothing to discuss at current topic.  \n\nSimple Internet Reality is: If something is really good, than don\u0027t worry, people on internet will find you even if you write in None-English on a None-English website with a simple post topic. (None-English\u003dRussian, Chinese, Japanese, Taiwan, .... even Turkish :smile:)  \n\nSo far increasing number of people come and find LiveXP, and made tutorials on their webpages etc.  \n\nPlease do NOT change the subject from Hiren to LiveXP. As I wrote **I NEVER write LiveXP as an alternative** neither to Hiren, nor to BartPE, UBCD, UBCDWin, BartPE, Sherpya-XPE .... If a user ask me \"how to obtain a quick rescue cd\", I would advice UBCDwin , UBCD and Hiren.  \n\nIf a user **have time** , than I would also advice learn LiveXP ![:rofl:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/roll1.gif) which I am sure (s)he will spend very good time ![:huh:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/huh.png)   \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n**Going back to subject of the topic:**   \nAs far as I remember, Hiren did not advertise himself through topics all over net etc. Instruction on its webpage is basic level of writing cd, creating ufd bootable and ingredients. (LiveXP do not need cd write tutorial since it has imgburn inside which executes at the end asking to write cd + we have more proper methods \\\u0026 tutorial to make bootable ufd on boot-land (ps: I always avoid making a script to prevent user blow up their ufd, following tutorials and tools of boot-land is already more proper \\\u0026 secure) + Ingredient of LiveXP always available [http://livexp.boot-land.net](http://livexp.boot-land.net \"External link\") )  \n\nHiren do not have tutorials to instruct end user how to use the tools inside etc.  \n\nHiren become more and more popular through years, hence there are lots of instructions and tutorials on multilanguage forums around the world. Reason is simple, Hiren is **very good** for a set of reasons. (I also do not like people asking things about Hiren on boot-land, not because it is warez, If they could use google they could already find answers for their questions, only some lazy guys come around time to time)  \n\nThis is not about Hiren only being Warez. There are lots of WAREZ distributions around with name Dark, Super, Hyper etc... and NONE of them is as famous as Hiren.  \nHere jaclaz made a good instruction about finding warez. [http://www.boot-land...showtopic\u003d10984](http://www.boot-land.net/forums/index.php?showtopic\u003d10984 \"External link\")  \nBut even jaclaz did not say writing \"Hiren\" on google is a way of finding warez :smile: .  \nIt is the name \"Hiren\", noooooooo. It is simple, Hiren is **very good** . If Hiren initially had a name \"Tomatho\" it will again will be as popular as today.  \n\nBartPE, UBCDWIN, Reatogo and SherpyaXPE are **very good** legit alternatives, Hence you can find lots of instructions and tutorials on multilanguage forums all around the world.  \nThere are lots personal pebuilder plugin (\u003dBartPE, UBCDWIN, Reatogo and SherpyaXPE) pages (legit \\\u0026 unlegit) that distributes a loooot of nice stuff.  \nThere are forums dedicated these plugins hence well organised, like the one on 911 [http://www.911cd.net...hp?showforum\u003d30](http://www.911cd.net/forums//index.php?showforum\u003d30 \"External link\")  \nEven today new projects based on pebuilder being created like [TeutonPE](http://www.boot-land.net/forums/index.php?showtopic\u003d10812 \"External link\"),  \nand I do not think Bart Lagerweij himself work on all these stuff himself. :smile:   \n\nSimple fact, pebuilder is **very good** .  \n\nAnd if something is **very good** , do not worry, people come and find you, hence make tutorials, instructions, contributions etc. etc.  \n\nComparing: To me LiveXP getting better and better, hence being more popular slowly with Galapo\u0027s great wisdom. Besides I do not care how much popularity (or well known) it has. LiveXP will NATURALLY get more popular with the continuation of its progress. I do not care when (or if) it will happen or if it can have a degree to get comparable level to above distributions. Life goes and we will see. Basicly The day LiveXP becomes **very good** from all level of end user, than it will, if not than who cares, but it will still have lovers on some level ![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif) .  \n\nI know my post will %95 not be replied properly as usual, for end words:  \nI highly respect success of at most BartPE (and Bart Lagerweij for his wisdom), than SherpyaXP, Reatogo, UBCD, UBCDWin and Hiren. Anyone who have a goal to make something popular should **understand** the reason behind their success. ![:rofl:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/roll1.gif)   \n"

I used Hirens a lot in the past, but run in so much issues booting a PC especially if it\u0027s a new board set to ACHI and the CD drive is SATA. It almost always failing loading the CD.   \n\nThen the light come on and I found Boot-land ![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif)   \n\nWhy would I waist my time trying to get Hirens booted if I can boot in a Windows enviroment??? That\u0027s why I love the Win7PE project. There is not a lot of systems you cannot boot and access the resources. Adding drivers is also a breeze.  \n\nThere were also a lot of discussion about the ease of use of projects like LiveXP etc to newbies. Well, this can be solved quite easily... The huge amount of knowledge on this forums, can solve this. On each project, there should be some sort of BASE build. This is basic thing that if executed \"out-of-the-box\" it should work. This will build the newbies confidence and should trigger their grey juices and hooked into one or more of the projects and contribute...  \n\nThen with the legal issues, well there is a LOT of freeware programs on the Hirens image. Why not use them? They are available in one place, only need to extract them and add them to the project. Then there is no issue. Just leave the illegal stuff alone and don\u0027t use them...  \n\nJust though to give my 10c worth.  \n\nRegards,   \n\n**Edited by MB_75, 14 December 2010 - 08:44 PM.**\n"
