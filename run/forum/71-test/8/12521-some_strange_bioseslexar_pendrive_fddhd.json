If so, what make, model and size are they?  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nSome BIOSes will not boot from a USB pen if larger than 512MB. Some BIOSes may boot if you use a partition table with two partitions (try RMPrepUSB with HDD option).   \n"

      "content": "\u003e Is there some other boot manager with own usb drivers ?\n**grub2** has its own USB drivers:  \n\u003e Many BIOSs do not support booting from USB, with this option you can use Super GRUB2 Disk (booted from a floppy, CD, or other media that your BIOS does support booting from) to boot an operating system from a USB drive despite your BIOSs limitation, using GRUB2\u0027s native USB drivers. This option will only allow you boot Free Operating Systems like GNU/Linux or FreeBSD, chainloading will not work with this option and so it cannot be used to boot Windows from a USB drive. This option, as stated, is still experimental.\n[http://www.supergrub...experimental.2A](http://www.supergrubdisk.org/wiki/SuperGRUB2Disk#Enable_GRUB2.27s_USB_support_.2Aexperimental.2A \"External link\")  \n[http://www.boot-land...mp;#entry109124](http://www.boot-land.net/forums/index.php?showtopic\u003d12395\u0026pid\u003d109124\u0026st\u003d10\u0026#entry109124 \"External link\")  \n\nMaybe **burg** (based on grub2) allows you to boot non-free Operating Systems too from USB:  \n[http://www.boot-land...showtopic\u003d12474](http://www.boot-land.net/forums/index.php?showtopic\u003d12474 \"External link\")   \n"
