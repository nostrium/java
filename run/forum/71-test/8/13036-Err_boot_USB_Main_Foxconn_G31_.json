I had no-boot problem with Transcend JF600 on AMIBIOS Biostar G31, but solved it by correct formatting.  \n\nYou can try the following in Bootice 0.8.1:  \nReformat USB disk first, choose USB-HDD mode (63 or 2048 alignment, I use last)  \nMBR -- UltraISO USB-HDD+ (should be set automaticaly, but check this)  \nPBR -- GRUB for DOS  \n\nThen copy on the UFD GRLDR and menu.lst that you have.   \n"
