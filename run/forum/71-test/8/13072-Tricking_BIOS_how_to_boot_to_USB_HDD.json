      "content": "Hi guys...I need help...I dont know if I\u0027m posting in the right place... :smile:  \n\nI have an old laptop Toshiba Satellite A60-S166 with ACPI BIOS (recently I have updated to latest version 1.90 provided in toshiba\u0027s site) it only have four boot options...HDD, CDROM, FDD (USB-FDD Legacy Emulation), and LAN (PXE)...it does not have option to boot from USB-HDD or USB-ZIP  \n\nRecently it cannot detect internal 30GB HDD anymore, and I think the internal HDD has broken and I have Seagate GoFlex 500GB USB-HDD...I want to be able to instal OS in my USB-HDD and boot from it instead of using LiveCD...I have ![:hi:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/hi.gif) around but cannot find solver to my problem...My questions are:  \n\n1. Is it possible to trick BIOS so it will see my USB-HDD as USB FDD and chainloader to primary OS? If so how can I do so? Step by step please :wink:  \n2. Or should I use or...is there any PATA-\\\u003eUSB connector and connect my USB-HDD directly to mainboard? Will it be possible?  \n\nthanks in advanced for boot masters in here ![:hi:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/hi.gif)   \n"
