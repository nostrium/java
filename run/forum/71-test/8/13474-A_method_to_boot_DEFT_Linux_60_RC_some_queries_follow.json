      "content": "I downloaded [DEFT Linux 6.0 RC](http://www.deftlinux.net/download/ \"External link\") (deft_6_rc.iso) . Within the ISO, **\\\\.disk\\\\info** file contains the following line  \n\n```\n\n\nLubuntu 10.10 \"Maverick Meerkat\" - i386 (20101010)\n\n```\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nwhich made me believe that the image is based on Ubuntu 10.10. Previously I experimented with **ubuntu-10.10-netbook-i386.iso** \\\u0026 was sure that the DEFT kernel supports **live-media-path** parameter. I extracted the image in a folder called **deft-6-rc** \\\u0026 my Grub4DOS menu.lst looks like  \n\n```\n\n\ntitle DEFT 6 RC\n\n  kernel\t\t/deft-6-rc/casper/vmlinuz file\u003d/deft-6-rc/preseed/ubuntu.seed boot\u003dcasper ignore_uuid live-media-path\u003d/deft-6-rc/casper/\n\n  initrd\t\t/deft-6-rc/casper/initrd.lz\n\n```\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nThe booting stopped with the error message that it can\u0027t find the squashfs image. It clearly indicates the DEFT kernel is not supporting **live-media-path** though it was supposed to do so. The I replaced the vmlinuz \\\u0026 initrd.lz of the DEFT CD with the ones from the Ubuntu netbook edition. Then the USB booted fine with the same menu.lst.   \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nBUT when the booting was done from DEFT ISO with its native kernel, then the desktop contains three icons - one evidence folder \\\u0026 two other shortcuts to Time \\\u0026 Date and shell. When the booting was done from the replaced Ubuntu kernel, the desktop shows only one shortcut of Install Ubuntu **9.04** (pretty amazing).  \n\nMy queries follow:  \n\n* Is it possible that Ubuntu 10.10 supports live-media-path but Lubuntu 10.10 does not?\n* How does the kernel make the difference in desktop environments?\n* How is it giving the option of installing Ubuntu **9.04**while the kernels are of Ubuntu 10.10?\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n"

To my understanding, linux kernel vmlinuz provides the basic wrapper around the HW \\\u0026 the low-level syscalls while initrd/initramfs contains a bare minimum filesystem in compressed format to be mounted @ boot-time. It\u0027s very much unlikely that either of them will incorporate a part of desktop environments like GNOME/KDE. I decompressed the original initrd where I found a folder called **evidence** . So now I got the answer that how the folder was there in original desktop. What about the other couple of shortcuts? Or it may be the shorcut files were also present in initrd, not sure about that. That\u0027s why I asked the question here.  \n\n\u003e I presume Sir Arthur Conan Doyle had higher expectations for his character\u0027s logical skills....  \nC\u0027mon, like my Italian neighbor is sceptical about my logical ability, someone from India can also doubt your [sanity](http://www.thefreedictionary.com/sanity \"External link\").   \n"

Either of the two combinations fails to mount the squashfs image. There is some version \\\u0026 argument mismatch.
