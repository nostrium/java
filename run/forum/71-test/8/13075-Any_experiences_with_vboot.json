Each file contains a single operating system. It supports Windows 2000, Windows XP, Vista, Windows 7, 2003 Server, 2008 Server and Linux 2.6, 32- and 64-bit. VBoot makes multiple boots extremly simple. You just simply copy a single file to a physical computer, and it can boot to the OS contained inside that file. VBoot provides native XP VHD boot, Vista VHD boot, Windows 7 VHD boot, Linux VHD boot, 2003 server VHD boot and 2008 server VHD boot.  \n\u003e\n\u003e You can use our MyOldPCs software to convert your XP machine to a VHD file, you can either run the VHD file as a virtual machine using VMLite Workstation, or use this same VHD file to boot your new physical PC directly to achieve even better performance.   \n\u003e\n\u003e [http://www.vmlite.co.../products/vboot](http://www.vmlite.com/index.php/products/vboot \"External link\")\n\n**Edited by skyide, 18 November 2010 - 11:42 PM.**\n"

Why Grub is required for Vboot?  \nThe boot loader of Vboot is just grub2 with an additional module vhd.mod that can read vhd files:  \n\u003e 4.2.2 Configure grub.cfg  \n\u003e\n\u003e A sample grub.cfg file is placed in c:\\\\vboot\\\\grub directory (or d:\\\\vboot\\\\grub depending on where you have copied the files). This is the GRUB2 configuratrion file to load operating systems. Inside this file, the vhd file path is hard coded, and thus you have to modify it.  \n\u003e\n\u003e grub.cfg is a text file that you can use notepad to open and modify. The relevant portion is shown below:  \n\u003e\n\u003e menuentry \"VHD Mint 9, Linux 2.6.32-21-generic\" {  \n\u003e insmod vhd  \n\u003e vhd vhd0 (hd0,1)/mint-9/mint-9-gnome-i386.vhd --partitions  \n\u003e linux (vhd0,1)/boot/vmlinuz-2.6.32-21-generic root\u003d/dev/sda1 vloop\u003d/mint-9/mint-9-gnome-i386.vhd quiet splash  \n\u003e initrd (vhd0,1)/boot/initrd.img-2.6.32-21-generic  \n\u003e }  \n\u003e\n\u003e menuentry groups a specific operating system. The first line insmod vhd inserts our vhd.mod module to the boot loader. vhd.mod is a GRUB2 module that treats a vhd file as hard disk, and allows GRUB2 to read files from the vhd. For example, the Linux kernel and initrd are loaded from the vhd file, as configured above.\nhttp://www.vmlite.com/index.php/forums/17-vboot/2495-linux-mint-9-vhd-available-for-download   \n"
