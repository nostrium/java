      "content": "Hi  \nJust tried this procedure and it worked for me, so i thought of sharing it here on Bootland, after all the info bootland has given, its time to give something back :wink:   \nThere must be easier ways, but this worked for me.  \n\nSay u have made a [***Sardu***](http://www.sarducd.it/ \"External link\") + [***G4D***](http://code.google.com/p/grub4dos-chenall/downloads/detail?name\u003dgrub4dos-0.4.5b-2010-08-12.zip\u0026can\u003d2\u0026q\u003d \"External link\") Multiboot USB and wanted to add [***Fedora 13***](http://fedoraproject.org/get-fedora \"External link\") Live CD/ISO to it, this is how i did it.  \n\n1)Download Fedora 13 from [here](http://fedoraproject.org/get-fedora \"External link\")  \n2)Download [liveusb-creator-3.9.2-setup.exe](https://fedorahosted.org/liveusb-creator/ \"External link\")   \n3)Take a spare empty USB pendrive, not the Main USB pendrive where u have the Sardu + G4D on.  \n4)Use liveusb-creator-3.9.2-setup.exe on it and follow the instructions and extract using liveusb-creator-3.9.2-setup.exe , the Fedora 13 live iso which u downloaded in step 1.  \n5)You get**boot, EFI, LiveOS, syslinux folders \\\u0026 a GPL file** . Now make a folder and call it fedora on this spare USB. Now the syslinux folder u put into a fedora folder which u must create. So u will have EFI, fedora, LiveOS folders \\\u0026 GPL file.![Posted Image](http://a.imageshack.us/img820/9749/fedorausbfiles.png)  \n6)Now transfer all the files and folders from your spare USB pendrive onto ur main USB pendrive where you have Sardu \\\u0026 G4d installed. If there is some file or folder like the boot folder or EFI folder and says it is already there, say yes to it, as they will integrate with the ones already there.  \n7)When u first created ur Sardu Menu on the Sardu USB (ie ur main USB), there is a folder called \"menu\" which is created in the root of your Sardu/G4d USB (ie the main USB). Inside this \"menu\" folder there are different \\*.cfg files which are created by the Sardu program.  \nTake one of them, say ***LINUX.CFG*** file and open it in notepad and add this code to the \"LINUX.CFG\" file.  \n\n```\n#boot di Fedora\n\nlabel Boot from Fedora\n\nmenu label Boot from ^Fedora\n\nMENU INDENT 1\n\nkernel /fedora/syslinux/vesamenu.c32\n\n\tAPPEND /fedora/syslinux/syslinux.cfg\n\n#\n```\n\nSee below picture [![Posted Image](http://a.imageshack.us/img97/2673/linuxcfg.png)](http://img97.imageshack.us/i/linuxcfg.png/ \"External link\")  \nSo by adding this code to the Linux.cfg file u can launch Fedora from Sardu menu screen. Below is a Sardu Menu screen from the USB pendrive where you can see Fedora option to launch.  \n[![Posted Image](http://a.imageshack.us/img718/787/screenshot1vy.jpg)](http://img718.imageshack.us/i/screenshot1vy.jpg/ \"External link\")  \n8)Next you have to find the [UUID (It is a Universally Unique IDentifier)](http://www.unixtutorial.org/2008/05/ubuntu-uuid-how-to/ \"External link\") for your USB pendrive where u have your Sardu + G4D installed (ie the main USB pendrive). To do this if you are using Linux OS (I used YlmF and than rechecked with Linux Mint, but other Linux OS will do the same too) than open a ***Terminal*** window. This is like a DOS like window. Same like a CMD window in WinXp.  \nOnce u open terminal window type this command (this is in a Linux OS environment)  \n\n```\nsudo ls -l /dev/disk/by-uuid\n```\n\nOr you can try the below one. The top one worked for me.  \n\n```\nsudo blkid\n```\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nYou will get the UUIDs for all ur partitions (internal HDD) and also for your main Sardu/G4D USB pendrive which you have to connect. But how will u know which one is for your main Sardu/G4D USB pendrive. For this u will have to check which one is your main Sardu/G4D USB pendrive bcos the partitions in linux are named as \"dev/sda1\" or \"dev/sdb1\" and so. Most probably if u have only one hardisk (internal), than that may have the name sda, so ur your main Sardu/G4D USB pendrive shld be sdb.  \nBut to be sure you can use GParted program which is there in YLMF or Linux Mint (other linuxes also have gparted). Once u open gparted u will know which one is your main Sardu/G4D USB pendrive and what is the real name of the your main Sardu/G4D USB pendrive (meaning if it is sdb1 or sdb3 or sda). So say if it is sdb1 , than in the terminal window check the **number** adjacent to sdb1. That is ur **UUID** of your main Sardu/G4D USB pendrive .   \n\nI just came across this tool while writing this post  \nIf you are a windows user and you want to find the UUID for your Sardu/G4d USB than download this [file from here](http://www.mediafire.com/?pvrsm6dijta79p2 \"External link\")   \n***NOTE:-***   \n(The Grub4DOS Toolbox for Windows-0.1.exe is already put inside a grub4dos folder where all the grub4dos files are present. So u will not have a problem to start Grub4DOS Toolbox for Windows-0.1.exe. Because if u download \\\u0026 launch Grub4DOS Toolbox for Windows-0.1.exe as a standlone file , it gives an error that it has to be launched from a grub4dos folder containing the grub4dos files. For that reason i have uploaded the Grub4DOS Toolbox for Windows-0.1.exe which i put in a Grub4dos folder having grub4dos files.)  \nUnrar/unzip the file to a folder and inside the folder there is a file called \"***Grub4DOS Toolbox for Windows-0.1.exe*** \" . Open this file and from the drop down menu you will find the option to Display the UUID and you can find the UUID if you are a windows user.  \n[![Posted Image](http://a.imageshack.us/img713/6522/uuidnoviawindows.png)](http://img713.imageshack.us/i/uuidnoviawindows.png/ \"External link\")  \nFor more info on UUID read [here](http://hubpages.com/hub/Finding-UUIDs-numbers \"External link\")   \n\n9)This UUID no has to be placed in the ***syslinux.cfg*** which is inside /fedora/syslinux/syslinux.cfg  \nand replace these 2 lines  \n\u003e kernel fedora/syslinux/vmlinuz0  \n\u003e append initrd\u003dfedora/syslinux/initrd0.img root\u003dlive:**UUID\u003d0AE2-1749** rootfstype\u003dvfat ro liveimg quiet rhgb rd_NO_LUKS rd_NO_MD\n\u003e kernel fedora/syslinux/vmlinuz0  \n\u003e append initrd\u003dfedora/syslinux/initrd0.img root\u003dlive:**UUID\u003d0AE2-1749** rootfstype\u003dvfat ro liveimg quiet rhgb check\nwith the new UUID no of your main Sardu/G4D USB pendrive . You will find these two above lines in the syslinux.cfg .Replace the UUID no in two places in the syslinux.cfg. Here i have uploaded my [syslinux.cfg](http://www.mediafire.com/?276u16qij5w3v93 \"External link\") file which u can just put the UUID no of your main Sardu/G4D USB pendrive in **two** places in the above syslinux.cfg file. (**DO NOT** use my UUID nos, the ones from the above code., it will not work, instead put UUID no of your main Sardu/G4D USB pendrive for it to work)  \nWith this you will be able to boot into your Sardu Menu and from there launch Fedora 13 Live  \n![:cheers:](https://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif)   \n"
