      "content": "\u003e everything seemed to work great -- but, i was unable to boot to xp without the usb drive plugged in.\nProbably your computer is NOT booting from the drive where XP is Installed. The Drive with XP is NOT yet the Active Boot Drive.  \nThis can be caused by a NON Standard Partitioning of the Harddisk.  \nYou can solve the problem by Setting the XP Drive **Active** .  \n\n* Boot XP with the USB-drive plugged in.\n* Open XP Disk Management (use R-mouse on My Computer) and **Set Active**the Drive with XP (use R-mouse menu on XP Partition)\n* Check also your boot.ini on XP drive and Check if essential XP boot files NTLDR and NTDETECT.COM are on the XP Drive.\n* ReBoot with NO USB-drive connected.\n\nEDIT: Thanks to jaclaz for remark on double negativ ![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif)   \nCorrected.   \n"
