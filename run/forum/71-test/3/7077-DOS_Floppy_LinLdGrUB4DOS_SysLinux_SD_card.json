I\u0027ve managed to access SD  \ncards under DOS after some EMM386 compatibility  \nissues were finally dealt with, i\u0027m now able to run  \n\u0027LinLD\u0027 (it was OKay from the start) or \u0027GrUB4DOS\u0027  \nwhen run from my diskette. \u0027Slax\u0027 does boot and  \nappears to be functionning normally if launched via  \nits \u0027\\\\BOOT\\\\DOS\\\\SLAX.BAT\u0027 DOS command file (it  \nis included on the LiveCD) so far. Unfortunately, i  \nfind it unconvenient to be limited to \u0027LinLD\u0027 because  \ni wish to customize the LiveCD\u0027s \u0027SysLinux\u0027 boot-  \ntime menu directly from the SD memory card... My  \ngoal is to have a boot method which is HardWare  \nindependant and works with any USB drive...  \n\nIt would be more suitable for me if i were able to  \nbenefit from the availability of \u0027LinLD\u0027 or even of  \n\u0027GrUB4DOS\u0027, eventually. So, is it possible to boot  \nfrom DOS and end up on the SD card booting \u0027Slax\u0027  \nLinux thru its \u0027SysLinux\u0027 menu as if it were a CD?...  \n\n![:poke:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/poke.gif)   \n"

To boot Linux from USB cardreader use the DOS USB driver and LinLD, to boot anything else you can use grub4dos.  \n\nIt\u0027s also possible to flip this, I mean using grub4dos as primary bootloader in MBR and to chainload DOS and later Linux with LinLD.

      "content": "Hi mr_,  \n\nYou\u0027ve got me right on the five 1st items:  \nit\u0027s a *legacy* BIOS with no USB boot option  \nat all, a \u0027PLoP\u0027 bootable diskette is able  \nto find USB FlashDrives directly attached  \nto the USB connector but it fails if using  \nan SD memory card reader attached to the  \nvery same USB/PCI controller card where i  \nconnected the external/frontal USB port,  \n\u0027LinLd v0.97\u0027 as run by the DOS batch-file  \nprovided on the \u0027Slax\u0027 LiveCD *works fine*   \nafter booting from a DOS bootable diskette  \nwith the suitable DOS USB drivers on it,  \nthose DOS USB drivers do allow **read/write**   \naccess to an SD memory card inserted in my  \nUSB card reader, i\u0027m trying to boot \u0027Slax\u0027  \nLinux from one of my SD cards. For the 6th  \npoint i\u0027d simply refer to my title above:  \n\nDOS (Floppy) - LinLd/GrUB4DOS - SysLinux (SD card)?  \n\nConsidering that \u0027LinLd\u0027 does work using a  \nDOS bootable diskette with USB drivers, it  \nseems i should be able to \"chainload\" the  \n\u0027SysLinux\u0027 boot-loader (or whatever that\u0027s  \ncalled) or, to the least, do that with the  \n\u0027GrUB\u0027 manager in the middle if i must...  \n\nI already have the DOS bootable diskette,  \nthe USB drivers load from \u0027Config.SYS\u0027 and  \nit seems i even managed to fix an \u0027EMM386\u0027  \ncompatibility issue with \u0027GrUB4DOS\u0027. The  \nSD cards get a DOS drive letter, i read/  \nwrite to the SD cards and i can navigate  \nto the \u0027\\\\BOOT\\\\DOS\\\\\u0027 directory in order to  \nrun \u0027SLAX.BAT\u0027 which is located there but  \nthe problem is it\u0027s using \u0027LinLd\u0027 *instead\nof* \u0027*SysLinux* \u0027 *as with the genuine LiveCD* .  \n\nOnce i\u0027m ready to run \u0027LinLd\u0027, if i could  \nuse \u0027GrUB4DOS\u0027 to get \u0027SysLinux\u0027 running  \nsomehow that would be good enough. I do  \nhave a bootable diskette with \u0027GrUB\u0027 which  \nboots DOS somewhere, i\u0027ll try to find out  \nif \u0027LinLd\u0027 still works once my USB drivers  \nare loaded by \u0027Config.SYS\u0027. What i don\u0027t  \nknow is how to use \u0027LinLd\u0027 to boot \u0027Slax\u0027  \nLinux through \u0027SysLinux\u0027 as on the LiveCD.  \n\nThank you for your time and effort.  \n\n![:poke:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/poke.gif)   \n"

The file is not generic (each time you change partitions you need to create it again). But the file can be chainloaded by grub4dos with chainloader /syslinux.bin. Syslinux.bin will keep care to load ldlinux.sys then.  \n\n\u003e DOS (Floppy) - LinLd/GrUB4DOS - SysLinux (SD card)?\n\nDOS (Floppy) -\\\u003e LinLd -\\\u003e SysLinux on USB cardreader: This can not work. LinLD can afaik only boot files in Linux kernel format. Syslinux is not in Linux kernel format and there is no Syslinux version in linux kernel format. EDIT: Even if syslinux would get somehow chainloaded from USB (supported by DOS USB driver) it would not work as syslinux is also using only the BIOS to access devices, DOS USB drivers are ignored.  \n\nDOS (Floppy) + DOS USB drivers -\\\u003e GrUB4DOS -\\\u003e SysLinux on USB cardreader: This can not work. grub4dos will freeze DOS (with option to unfreeze) and use only the BIOS (which has no USB support) in order to chainload other devices, therefore grub4dos is not aware of the USB cardreader.  \n\nIf the USB cardreader is not seen by PLoP Bootmanager (this is the case here) you can only do it like:  \nBIOS -\\\u003e floppy with DOS and DOS USB driver -\\\u003e LinLD -\\\u003e Linux kernel.  \n\n\u003e What i don\u0027t  \n\u003e know is how to use \u0027LinLd\u0027 to boot \u0027Slax\u0027  \n\u003e Linux through \u0027SysLinux\u0027 as on the LiveCD.\nI think LinLD is not the correct tool to do this.  \n\nDo you mean to chainload a real live cd or a iso as live cd?  \n\nFor a real live cd:  \ngrub4dos can chainload CD even if BIOS has no native support to boot from CD. In case grub4dos is not working you can also try the Bootable CD Loader, all informations about this topic is inside the grub4dos guide  \n[http://diddy.boot-la...os/Grub4dos.htm](http://diddy.boot-land.net/grub4dos/Grub4dos.htm \"External link\")  \n\nFor live cd in iso format:  \nThat\u0027s another big story, has been discussed in the forums.   \n"

Probably it wasn\u0027t clear enough.  \n\n* You have to make a disk image of 8 MB (slax.img) or larger (depends on the size of the /boot folder of slax). Make a hard disk image, install syslinux as bootloader on it. Copy the whole boot folder of slax to the hard disk image.\n* Put this hard disk image on your SD card (slax.img)\n* Put the /slax folder on your SD card.\n* Put grub.exe on your SD card.\n* Make the config file for kexec-loader:  \n  You can use the label name of your SD card to set the root device in kexec-loader (e.g. label \u0027SLAX\u0027).  \n\n  ```\n  root LABEL\u003dSLAX\n\n  title Slax\n\n  kernel /grub.exe --config-file\u003d\u0026#34;find --set-root /boot/slax.cfg; chainloader +1\u0026#34;\n\n  initrd /slax.img\n  ```\n\n  \u003cbr /\u003e\n\n* This will first boot kexec-loader, which can see your SD card.\n* kexec-loader will find his config file on the SD card.\n* kexec-loader will then grab grub.exe and slax.img from the SD card.\n* kexec-loader will boot grub.exe with slax.img as ramdisk.\n* grub.exe will boot syslinux from the slax.img (which is in memory now, so grub.exe can access this image) by chainloading the first sector.\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nSo you will still have the syslinux menu, from which you can choose the options that you like.   \n"

Install **syslinux** to it.\n* Compress this image with gzip so it will fit on a floppy (will be only a few kb in size now) (**slaxhd.gz**).\n* Make a floppy with **grldr** as boot loader, add **grub.exe** , add the files of your dos image and the compressed harddisk image (**slaxhd.gz**) of the previous step to it.\n* Make a **menu.lst** on the floppy:  \n\n  ```\n  timeout 0\n\n\n\n  title Boot Slax from SD\n\n  map --mem \u0026#40;fd0\u0026#41;/slaxhd.gz \u0026#40;hd0\u0026#41;\n\n  map --hook\n\n  root \u0026#40;fd0\u0026#41;\n\n  kernel /io.sys\n  ```\n\n  It will first make a virtual hd drive, to which you can write later.  \n  Then it will boot msdos.\n* Add code in your **autoexec.bat** that copies the **/boot** folder of slax from the SD card to the memory mapped hard disk image.\n* After that, add the following in **autoexec.bat** :  \n\n  ```\n  grub.exe --config-file\u003d\u0026#34;root \u0026#40;hd0\u0026#41;; chainloader +1\u0026#34;\n  ```\n\n  This will boot the syslinux bootloader from the virtual hard drive. The contents of the virtual hard drive are copied each time from the SD card before booting, so if you edit **syslinux.cfg** on the SD card, the menu on the virtual hard drive changes to. So you can update slax to a new version very easily (just update the file on the SD card). Maybe you can make the virtual hard disk image bigger than 8MB to be sure that you don\u0027t need to make it again because the /boot folder did grow in size.\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n"

For the 6th  \npoint i\u0027d simply refer to my title above:  \n\nDOS (Floppy) - LinLd/GrUB4DOS - SysLinux (SD card)?  \n\nConsidering that \u0027LinLd\u0027 does work using a  \nDOS bootable diskette with USB drivers, it  \nseems i should be able to \"chainload\" the  \n\u0027SysLinux\u0027 boot-loader (or whatever that\u0027s  \ncalled) or, to the least, do that with the  \n\u0027GrUB\u0027 manager in the middle if i must...  \n\nI already have the DOS bootable diskette,  \nthe USB drivers load from \u0027Config.SYS\u0027 and  \nit seems i even managed to fix an \u0027EMM386\u0027  \ncompatibility issue with \u0027GrUB4DOS\u0027.

The file is not generic (each time you change partitions you need to create it again). But the file can be chainloaded by grub4dos with chainloader /syslinux.bin. Syslinux.bin will keep care to load ldlinux.sys then.  \n\n\u003e DOS (Floppy) - LinLd/GrUB4DOS - SysLinux (SD card)?\n\nDOS (Floppy) -\\\u003e LinLd -\\\u003e SysLinux on USB cardreader: This can not work.

Probably it wasn\u0027t clear enough.  \n\n* You have to make a disk image of 8 MB (slax.img) or larger (depends on the size of the /boot folder of slax). Make a hard disk image, install syslinux as bootloader on it. Copy the whole boot folder of slax to the hard disk image.\n* Put this hard disk image on your SD card (slax.img)\n* Put the /slax folder on your SD card.\n* Put grub.exe on your SD card.\n* Make the config file for kexec-loader:  \n  You can use the label name of your SD card to set the root device in kexec-loader (e.g. label \u0027SLAX\u0027).  \n\n  ```\n  root LABEL\u003dSLAX\n\n  title Slax\n\n  kernel /grub.exe --config-file\u003d\u0026#34;find --set-root /boot/slax.cfg; chainloader +1\u0026#34;\n\n  initrd /slax.img\n  ```\n\n  \u003cbr /\u003e\n\n* This will first boot kexec-loader, which can see your SD card.\n* kexec-loader will find his config file on the SD card.\n* kexec-loader will then grab grub.exe and slax.img from the SD card.\n* kexec-loader will boot grub.exe with slax.img as ramdisk.\n* grub.exe will boot syslinux from the slax.img (which is in memory now, so grub.exe can access this image) by chainloading the first sector.\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nSo you will still have the syslinux menu, from which you can choose the options that you like.   \n"

Install **syslinux** to it.\n* Compress this image with gzip so it will fit on a floppy (will be only a few kb in size now) (**slaxhd.gz**).\n* Make a floppy with **grldr** as boot loader, add **grub.exe** , add the files of your dos image and the compressed harddisk image (**slaxhd.gz**) of the previous step to it.\n* Make a **menu.lst** on the floppy:  \n\n  ```\n  timeout 0\n\n\n\n  title Boot Slax from SD\n\n  map --mem \u0026#40;fd0\u0026#41;/slaxhd.gz \u0026#40;hd0\u0026#41;\n\n  map --hook\n\n  root \u0026#40;fd0\u0026#41;\n\n  kernel /io.sys\n  ```\n\n  It will first make a virtual hd drive, to which you can write later.  \n  Then it will boot msdos.\n* Add code in your **autoexec.bat** that copies the **/boot** folder of slax from the SD card to the memory mapped hard disk image.\n* After that, add the following in **autoexec.bat** :  \n\n  ```\n  grub.exe --config-file\u003d\u0026#34;root \u0026#40;hd0\u0026#41;; chainloader +1\u0026#34;\n  ```\n\n  This will boot the syslinux bootloader from the virtual hard drive. The contents of the virtual hard drive are copied each time from the SD card before booting, so if you edit **syslinux.cfg** on the SD card, the menu on the virtual hard drive changes to. So you can update slax to a new version very easily (just update the file on the SD card). Maybe you can make the virtual hard disk image bigger than 8MB to be sure that you don\u0027t need to make it again because the /boot folder did grow in size.\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n"
