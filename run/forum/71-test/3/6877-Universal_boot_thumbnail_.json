      "content": "I was doing some research on booting from a thumb nail drive. It seems some computers can not boot from usb drives. Their bios does not support it.  \n\nFrom my research there seems to be a couple of options.  \n\nA u3 thumbnail OR grub4dos. Has anyone have any luck with these.  \n\nIf one was to use grub4dos; I think he would have to boot grub4dos from a CD before he could boot from the thumbnail.  \n\nWould have to be able to boot from a 64 bit computer  \n\nWould any other boot loaders work ?  \n\nHas anyone done it using au3 thumbnail ?  \n\nAny ideas on this ?   \n"
