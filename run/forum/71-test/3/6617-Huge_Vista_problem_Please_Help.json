      "content": "Let me start by saying that I claim to have absolutely no knowledge regarding the technical in\u0027s and out\u0027s of PCs. I do know how to use them in the usual day-to-day activities that revolve around the home and school environment. Outside of that, every bit of information I have acquired has been through the school of trial and error. With that said I will try to describe my situation as best I can.....  \n\nI have a Gateway Desktop, model GT5404 with a few minor upgrades by way of video card, sound card, and ram. It came with Vista Home Premium installed and, for the record, this machine is the first experience I have had with Vista...period. Several weeks ago I started to notice some quirky behavior regarding switching to and from user accounts and ending up in a neverending user account screen cycle. The only way to get around it involved a complete restart, so I started looking online for information as to what the cause may or not be. I will add that Kaspersky ran as the AV program supplemented by Uniblue\u0027s Powersuite. After much looking, reading and online chatting it became apparent that the common denominator may have been a recent security install due to automatic updates. I went into the event viewer, found the installs that coincided with the buggy issue and (Heaven Help Me!) deleted them to the recycle bin. Yes I know now...not a good move... After the next restart, Vista invariably gave me an blue error screen. Going down the checklist I tried to boot in any of the available safe modes, to no avail. Either a blue error screen or a loop back to the \u0027Advanced Boot Options\u0027 menu. Next step was to try to repair/reinstall the OS from operating system disk that came with the pc. No luck there either. The screen hangs on the system32/drivers screen on the crcdisk file. I can\u0027t even get to the repair/reinstall screen. Next logical step after perusing the web was to find a way to boot up, if nothing else but to determine that all information was still intact. I burned an image of Ubuntu to disk and changing boot priority was able to launch in linux. All programs and files intact. Okay, cool. Now mind you, at this point of this wonderful endeavour I must have greyed 5 years, because I know nothing about linux, grub4dos, emulators, command lines, etc., but I do now within this 3 day crash course. I have burned several other recovery cds to see if they would boot, but no luck. Same result as the original OS disk. I have come to the conclusion that I need to fix those files, or put them back, or find some way to chkdisk or fix the boot registry. Can this be done by way of grub4dos? I am really trying to avoid buying another SATA drive, installing the OS, and installing it into the tower just to fix the problem. Any advice, help, or insight would be greatly appreciated. The ironic thing is...despite the frustration of the situation, I am really enjoying learning more about just how expansive everything is \u0027behind the scenes\u0027 so to speak.   \n"

      "content": "Hi Spectre,  \n\nFirst of all, welcome to our community.   \n\nDon\u0027t worry if you feel like a newbie, I think that you have made a very detailed description of what has gone wrong with your machine and this really helps other members around here to think on solutions for this case.  \n\nWe\u0027re all here to learn and talk with each others so let\u0027s see what can be done.  \n\nBut, some things to note:  \n\n- The \"hello topic\" should be reserved just for a quick introduction of yourself and we\u0027d all appreciate if this topic discussion would take place at a more appropriate section just to keep our talks all tidy and organized on the right places.  \n\n- Second, you should add some line breaks. This would really make the text much easier to read as people often find it difficult to guide the eyes to the next correct line when reading.  \n\n*It\u0027s not your fault, I guess that the instructions at the registration page kind of invite to do this since it\u0027s not the first time it happens.*   \n\n----------------  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nLast but not least, a quick of steps to take:  \n\n- Get youself an external drive and copy all your files for safe keeping (documents, pictures, etc)  \n- Use a boot disk with DriveImageXML or any other good tool to backup the drive onto the external drive as well (LiveXP already comes with DIMXML) to later restore back if anything goes wrong.  \n- Save the Vista Activation file - [http://www.google.pt...r...uisar\\\u0026meta\u003d](http://www.google.pt/search?hl\u003dpt-PT\u0026rlz\u003d1G1GGLQ_PT-BRXX255\u0026q\u003dbackup+Vista+activation\u0026btnG\u003dPesquisar\u0026meta\u003d \"External link\")  \n\n--------  \n\nAnd then I\u0027d say install a fresh Vista and restore the original activation.  \n\n*(but we should really discuss this on a more appropriate forum section..)*   \n\n![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif)   \n"

      "content": "From what you write, you seem to have inadvertedly deleted some SYSTEM files.  \n\nThus the only way out would be to restore the files you deleted.  \n\nGrub4dos or any other bootmanager cannot help you, since the problem happens in a later stage.  \n\nIf the deleted files are still in the Recycle bin, you can try using the Ubuntu or another bootdisk to restore them to where you deleted them from.  \n\nMost probably you have in your installed system, upgraded to SP1 whilst your original CD is SP0 or \"gold\".  \n\nYou can try creating a new CD slipstreaming SP1 and try a repair install.  \n\nI am afraid that apart these \"simple\" steps, further attempts may require a knowledge of the OS that you appear as not having at the moment.  \n\nTo create a slipstreamed CD/DVD:  \n[http://www.dslreport...fairly-painless](http://www.dslreports.com/forum/r20259366-Slipstream-Vista-SP1-using-vLite-fairly-painless \"External link\")  \n\nThe procedure itself is not the easiest one inthe world and you\u0027ll need to use another computer ....![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif)  \n\njaclaz   \n"

      "content": "(RE: jaclaz reply)  \nThank you for the reply. I do have access to another computer at my workstation. Actually two to be exact...a toshiba laptop running XP and another desktop running XP as well. I\u0027m trying to work off the laptop as much as possible because I only have one moniter with me here so using the other desktop requires switching cables back and forth. ![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif) Nonetheless, I will jump in with both feet and check out your link and, God-willing, find a solution to the problem. I see you mentioned that it wouldn\u0027t be easy, but to be honest, the joy in learning facing a challenge invariably rides on the tails of some frustration. :wink: I will give it my best and post what results I come up with.  \n\nI do apologize to the site admins/moderators for misplacing my original post as I know this probably isn\u0027t the place for this discussion. If anyone with the ability to place this topic into the correct area I would appreciate it greatly. It seems that this is a great community of individuals and I would hate to ruffle the wrong feathers, so to speak. LOL.   \n"
