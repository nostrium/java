      "content": "OK. Got it. Mostly done now but for the tweaking...details follow - but first, an example:  \n\nSome while back I was visiting someone who happens to be an IT director for a big co.  \nand who was their net admin before that for quite a few years.  \nBeing a guest from afar I was told I was welcome to use his PC for email etc.  \nI did some very routine stuff - webmail, news, weather, travel related stuff...then fate struck.  \nAs I sat there helplessly - his supposedly well protected, very new PC became a slave of  \nwho knows what and I, the user - seemingly had no control anymore at all. Really.  \nI ended the onslaught by unplugging his network cable and I went and got him right away.  \nDamn it, he says - now I gotta reinstall windows AGAIN ! And he did too. Wasted several  \nhours getting it cleaned off and running in a minimal state again.  \nThis was a life-changing event for me. We spoke of it - and turns out it was not so unusual  \nfor him - either at home, or at work - but for me it stimulated visions of shivering horrors.  \nReinstalling windows and all needed programs ? Semi-regularly ?! That\u0027s REALLY nasty.  \nOver time I\u0027d observed that XP users seemed to have a much harder time of keeping their  \ndaily-use PCs running steadily than I ever had whilst using good \u0027ol win2kpro.  \n\nTime passed and hardware now demands a minimum of XP. Doggone it; my w2k system  \nis now also beyond tired. Time to take it all in and adjust as needed. One thing though:  \nI will NOT be stuck with a non-bootable or inaccessible system due to lack of options.  \nNo way.  \nThen I saw that other post here and my old noggin started considering the options...  \nand here I am - what a ride this has been !!!  \n\nSo here\u0027s what I ended up with:  \n2 primary partitions - the 1st being FAT16 with System Commander 8, FreeDOS, NTFSPro,  \nBartPE, and something called MicroXP a friend gave me that was the best thing that could  \nhave ever happened !  \nThe 2nd primary is the existing/tweaked up XP SP2 that I already had and was using, and  \ncopied onto this used HDD to play with.  \nThe rest of the drive is all extended/logical space for data, programs, etc.  \n\nI thought I could EASILY get XP to accept the transition from primary to logical and that  \nwas not to happen - it would boot and the drive letters worked OK, but trying to get it  \nall together with a bootmanager was just pure h\\*ll I\u0027ll tell you.  \nI tried every bootmanager on the planet that I could find and they ALL had some kind  \nof problem with the primary\\\u003c-\\\u003elogical booting combo, so I gave it up.  \nMost then revealed themselves to have trouble still with multi-booting from a single  \nprimary with FreeDOS/BartPE/MicroXP, and those got dumped for good and all.  \nLucky me though - I remembered I\u0027ve had System Commander hanging around so I  \ndusted it off and installed it - Viola - that\u0027s the fix I needed !  \nBest of all it hides the repair partition SO WELL from the daily use OS that I am delighted.  \n\nHere\u0027s one example of a simple fix that would be made easy and quick now:  \nRemoving a bad driver file.  \nI had installed a freeware to change the default (advertising, yuck !) boot screen - but  \nit was not reliable and needed to go after it would boot to an all black screen about 1/2  \nthe time.  \nI needed to simply delete \u0027vidstub.sys\u0027 from my OS in all it\u0027s NTFS glory - so to do this  \nlittle bit I had to boot from a CD (yawn), delete it, and reboot (Zzzzzz). No more.  \nNow I just start FreeDOS w/ NTFSPro, then Xtree (yep, really) - find it -\\\u003e D, y -\\\u003e do  \nthe 3-finger salute, and all is well. Total time spent - maybe 1 1/2 minutes.  \n\nI now have LOTS of experience with LOTS of bootmanagers and I can tell you that I\u0027m  \nreally glad that I started with System Commander back in the OS/2 days, because it  \neven blew away BootIt NG and OSL2000 by MILES. I highly recommend it.  \n\nOK - now I gotta get back to finalizing this gizmo - and this may be the last post I make  \nanyplace from my dear old w2k system...how sad and wonderful at the same time !   \n"
