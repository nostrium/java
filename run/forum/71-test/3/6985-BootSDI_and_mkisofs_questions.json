      "content": "Hello Bootland . . .  \n\nBooting a BootSDI-CD led me to the question how to install this system to Harddisk.  \nFirst I was using BartPE-Installer: creating Minint-Directory and Programs/Programme.  \nBut this method doesn´t take advantage of the PE-2-RAM-loading of BootSDI.  \nTo change this I moved the original BootSDI.iso from Winbuilder´s OutputFolder to C:\\\\ and made an entry in boot.ini for grldr,  \nand one entry in menu.lst for BootSDI.iso.  \nWhen booting the Harddisk you can call Grub4Dos from boot.ini, and Grub4Dos can call BootSDI.iso to load.  \nYou need 3 files: BootSDI.iso, grldr and ntldr(might be on C:\\\\).  \nYou have to modify 2 other files: boot.ini and menu.lst.  \nAnd that´s it !  \nBut normally the BootSDI.iso isn´t on the BootSDI-CD so you can´t install to HDD.  \n\nNow my idea is to rebuild the BootSDI.iso from the BootSDI-CD:  \nWhat2Do:  \n-boot the BootSDI-CD.  \n-copy all files from BootSDI-CD(source) to TEMP-folder.  \n-add bootsect.bin that might be hidden.  \n-compile the ISO by mkisofs.exe.  \n-copy grldr and ntldr to C:\\\\  \n-make entries in boot.ini and menu.lst.  \n\nThis could be done by a simple batchfile, if there was not one tricky part:  \nmkisofs doesn´t behave like in real-XP.  \nThough the cloned ISO can boot any PC (burned on Disk), it will not be accepted by Grub4Dos.  \ngrldr says: \"Error 60: File for drive emulation must be in one contiguous disk area\",  \nalthough the ISO is placed in C:\\\\, according to menu.lst.  \n\nQuestion:  \nWhy does mkisofs act so strange ?  \nHow could one come around this issue ?  \n\nT.   \n"

      "content": "Hello Bootland . . .  \n\nBooting a BootSDI-CD led me to the question how to install this system to Harddisk.  \nFirst I was using BartPE-Installer: creating Minint-Directory and Programs/Programme.  \nBut this method doesn´t take advantage of the PE-2-RAM-loading of BootSDI.  \nTo change this I moved the original BootSDI.iso from Winbuilder´s OutputFolder to C:\\\\ and made an entry in boot.ini for grldr,  \nand one entry in menu.lst for BootSDI.iso.  \nWhen booting the Harddisk you can call Grub4Dos from boot.ini, and Grub4Dos can call BootSDI.iso to load.  \nYou need 3 files: BootSDI.iso, grldr and ntldr(might be on C:\\\\).  \nYou have to modify 2 other files: boot.ini and menu.lst.  \nAnd that´s it !  \nBut normally the BootSDI.iso isn´t on the BootSDI-CD so you can´t install to HDD.  \n\nNow my idea is to rebuild the BootSDI.iso from the BootSDI-CD:  \nWhat2Do:  \n-boot the BootSDI-CD.  \n-copy all files from BootSDI-CD(source) to TEMP-folder.  \n-add bootsect.bin that might be hidden.  \n-compile the ISO by mkisofs.exe.  \n-copy grldr and ntldr to C:\\\\  \n-make entries in boot.ini and menu.lst.  \n\nThis could be done by a simple batchfile, if there was not one tricky part:  \nmkisofs doesn´t behave like in real-XP.  \nThough the cloned ISO can boot any PC (burned on Disk), it will not be accepted by Grub4Dos.  \ngrldr says: \"Error 60: File for drive emulation must be in one contiguous disk area\",  \nalthough the ISO is placed in C:\\\\, according to menu.lst.  \n\nQuestion:  \nWhy does mkisofs act so strange ?  \nHow could one come around this issue ?  \n\nT.   \n"

      "content": "@Tokener  \nParts from first post Booting a BootSDI-CD led me to the question how to install this system to Harddisk.   \n\u003e\n\u003e But normally the BootSDI.iso isn´t on the BootSDI-CD so you can´t install to HDD.  \n\u003e\n\u003e Now my idea is to rebuild the BootSDI.iso from the BootSDI-CD:\nI undestand:  \nFirst you like to boot the BootSDI-CD.  \nNext you like to copy BootSDI-CD to hard disk and make it bootable.  \n\n\u003e But normally the BootSDI.iso isn´t on the BootSDI-CD so you can´t install (it) to HDD.\nThat\u0027s true and false.  \n\nYes, there is no file BootSDI.iso at CD.  \n\nHowever the BootSDi-cd is a result of the previous ISO image.   \nHence the ISO image is available at CD still.  \n\nThere is no need to recreate this ISO image again.  \nNo need to copy files to hard disk temp directory.  \nNo need for a file bootsect.bin.  \n\nBoot BootSDi-cd and extract cd to a file\n\n```\ndd if\u003d\\\\.\\x\u0026#58; of\u003dC\u0026#58;\\LIVEXP.ISO bs\u003d20480\n```\n\nAdd grldr and adjust menu.lst.   \n"
