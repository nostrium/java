      "content": "Usboot is great to come thought the fiddling of USB booting and starting Windows. I am using my XP on USB on different computers and come along some problems.  \n\nOne one computer (notebook) there is an W-LAN chip and you need the driver and software from intel, on another computer has a ATI card the next one Nvidia and so on.  \n\nMost of those drivers are not designed in order to work with different hardware profiles, this means the software will still load even if the device is not attached. The driver software adds autostart entry, registry autostart, drivers and windows services, etc...  \n\nI was trying the internal windows function hardware profiles but this doesn\u0027t help much as it don\u0027t care about autostart.  \n\nAfter installing the \"wrong\" driver software or \"to much\" there will be serious issues like bluescreen while booting.  \n\nDo you have a suggestion for me how to overcome this? (not the bluescreen, the driver software management on different hardware at all)   \n"

      "content": "Using again this method [http://www.nu2.nu/bootdisk/ntboot/](http://www.nu2.nu/bootdisk/ntboot/ \"External link\") on my USB-HDD. When I plug in the disk in VMware as physical disk (raw) it will boot ok. On bare metal it\u0027s same error message as no boot medium inserted and PLoP will show  \n........  \nMissing operating system. I was wondering why I can not get my 2.5\" USB HDD bootable anymore on USB.   \n\nSo I tested the same with a pen drive, same results, bootable on VMware raw but not with VMware/PLoP or bare metal.  \n\nStrange... After using the HP Drive Key I could finally get \\*something\\* on USB bootable again with VMware/PLoP.  \n\nCan you tell me why it\u0027s booting on raw but not when connected by USB? Isn\u0027t the MBR/PBR/filesystem the same? What\u0027s the difference?  \n\nAlso when I use USBoot to copy XP to the single primary/active/nonhidden NTFS partition on USB it will be bootable fine as raw, but not as USB.  \n\nVery strange (it WAS already working in past), can you tell me what to do to ensure to get my USB-HDD bootable for NTFS / NT again?   \n"
