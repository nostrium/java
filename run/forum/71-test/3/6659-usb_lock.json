      "content": "I read an article somewhere (not sure if it was here or not) about how to build a login device using a usb thumb drive. (without any software) I am unable to fine this article without using a 3rd party app.. The article I read was how to do this and edit the registry to some degree to allow this function.. Like a finger print reader.. I understand that if anyone should get this thumb drive it would be a huge security risk... I also saw a 3rd party app called [Rohos logon key](http://www.rohos.com/configuring_usb_stick_logon.htm \"External link\") $25 to allow the thumb drive and a passcode to be used with that thumb drive.. neat idea.. Can this be done with free utilities or even better just tweaking the registry?   \n\nThanks for the help  \n\nMyk3   \n"
