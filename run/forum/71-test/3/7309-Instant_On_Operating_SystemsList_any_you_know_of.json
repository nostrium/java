Interesting thing here is that it is Hardware Independent which is a nice twist to Instant ON systems. Looks like a linux distro, Any possibility in booting this thing up from grub4dos? You can sign up for beta testing on their site and take a look in a couple of weeks... [http://www.prestomypc.com/index.php](http://www.prestomypc.com/index.php \"External link\")   \n"

Next time you turn on your computer, you\u0027ll have the choice of running Windows or Presto. With Presto, you\u0027re automatically connected to your network and productive in seconds. You can easily access your Windows files. When you\u0027re done using Presto, you can turn off your laptop instantly. You can even uninstall Presto using the Windows Add/Remove Programs control panel.\n\nCan you explain to me now, how it works? ![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif)  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif)   \n"

Presto is pretty good at detecting the many combinations of technology that exist. However, there\u0027s a chance that your particular computer contains something that Presto doesn\u0027t recognize.  \n\u003e\n\u003e If you see an error message when you run Presto for the first time, please complete this form so Presto can be improved and arrangements can be made to refund your purchase if necessary.
