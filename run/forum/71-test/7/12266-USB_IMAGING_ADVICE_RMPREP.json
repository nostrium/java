      "content": "Hi  \n\nI really like the speeds of RMPREP imaging utility but I just cant get it to work how I want to.  \n\nMaybe I cant do this but please help if I can.  \n\nMy Main USB is 32gb. The data is about 7.5 gb.  \nI want to make an image that I can \"roll out\" to other smaller say 16 or 8 USB sticks.  \n\nI know I can specifiy the number of bytes the image can be when taking a clone so I tried this.  \n1. Stuck the 32 in  \n2. USB to file.  \n3. selected the byte size of the total ammount of data on the stick.  \n4. completed process.  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nTHEN TO TEST  \n1. Stuck in test 8gb  \n2. File to USB  \n3. Loaded file from above  \n4. Complete without errors.  \n\nHowever straight away windows says its corrupt and unreadable, I even couldnt get any machines to format it because it hung the system. Good job my main stick has a linux distro on there to smash it back into action.  \n\nGparted was having trouble with the imaged stick, it said something about file table being outside of the disk area, only when I reloaded a new partition table was I able to get it formatted etc.  \n\nWhats wrong team? ![:mellow:](https://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/mellow.png)   \n"

You need to be careful of how you partition (not format) the USB drive and on what system you do this.  \n\nAlso, as I have said before - always start from a cold (off) system. Are you doing this?  \n\nRMPrepUSB will always partition and format the USB drive in the same way (same cyl/hds/sectors) regardless of what system you partition and format it on - HP Format may not and it may depend on the BIOS to determine no. of cyls/hds/sectors. So are you always using the same system to partition these pens on?  \n\nSome BIOSes look at the \\*\\*current\\*\\* partition table to determine how many heads per cylinders to use for disk LBA translation. If the partition table has 240 hds per cyl then it will use 240 for LBA conversion. Some (more modern) BIOSes do not do this and just use 255. So if it originally had 240 hpc a partition program may use 240 again as it gets the current chs params from the BIOS when it partitions the drive.  \n\nSuggest you **always use RMPrepUSB for partitioning** and you should get consistent results as it does not use any system calls to get disk parameters when creating the partition table (i.e. will always boot on system x or will never boot on system x).   \n"

(the image that got the sticks working on the machine again which then was imaged in rmprep and working)  \n\nImaging aside, I never had any hassle, getting g4d to boot on hardly anything, I even just formated in windows sometimes and then put g4d on and thats it no problem.  \n\nI think now I want to sack of the imaging side of this problem and just concentrate on getting it to boot g4d, then I can take care of the rest and sort the images. I think a fluke scenario hit one of the images and I need to know rather rely on some freak thing that got it working  \n\nRight Im going to find some different \"same\" machines and test, seems too complicated all of a sudden has to be simpler   \n"

(one of those that give you problems)\n* Add to it GRLDR(or NTLDR) and see if you have the blinking cursor on THAT SAME machine.\n* If not, save it\u0027s MBR.\n* If yes, save it\u0027s MBR all the same.\n* Give to the files a meaningful name, like MBR_PC_7800_working.mbr\n* Additionally, save the first secotr of the first partition (bootsector)\n* Give to the file a meaningful name, like BS_PC_7800_working.mbr\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nRepeat the above steps on another machine (one of those that do normally work).  \n\nName the two machines (say first one is 7800 and second one is \"IBM\").  \n\nCompress the two MBR\u0027s AND the two Bootsectors in a .zip file and upload it to a file sharing service and post a link.  \n\nYou can use HDhacker allright to save this sectors, if dsfo scares you ![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif):  \n[http://dimio.altervi.../eng/index.html](http://dimio.altervista.org/eng/index.html \"External link\")  \n\nBTW, the problem can normally be solved by patching the bootsector.  \n\n![:(](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/sad.png)  \nWonko   \n"

RMPrepUSB will always use 255 (or 64/32 if you tell it to), but HPformat may use \u0027system\u0027 BIOS geometry.  \n\nYour problem may be that you have used HPFormat (\u003dworked as 240 hds) but then went to **partitioning** using RMPrep Prepare (255 hds).
