      "content": "Hello everyone!  \n\nCurrently I\u0027m looking for a bootloader:  \n- which can be booted from say a USB thumbdrive  \n- allows each OS on each HD to be independent and unaware of one another (Windows won\u0027t know Linux exists on another HD)  \n- if I were to remove the USB thumbdrive with the bootloader, it would just load up the master HD\u0027s OS with no hitches  \n- if I were to remove a HD with an OS, it wouldn\u0027t behave differently (maybe not show the option to boot that OS)  \n\nI just want something that will keep each OS install separate without having to constantly mind the Windows bootloader taking over the Linux one or vice versa.  \n\nDoes such a bootloader exist!? Is there one with nice graphics (Like Cameleon2) ?  \n\nSorry if I posted this in the wrong forum.   \n"

(just look in the sub-forums)  \n\nThere is NOT an automatic provision to do this, anyway:  \n\u003e - if I were to remove a HD with an OS, it wouldn\u0027t behave differently (maybe not show the option to boot that OS)\nyou will have to remove the entry in the menu manually.  \n\nThe graphical look can be simple or complex, here are a couple example screenshots:  \n[http://www.msfn.org/...o...129399\\\u0026st\u003d5](http://www.msfn.org/board/index.php?showtopic\u003d129399\u0026st\u003d5 \"External link\")  \n\n![:mellow:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/mellow.png)  \nWonko   \n"
