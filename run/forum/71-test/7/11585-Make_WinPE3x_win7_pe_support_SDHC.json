      "content": "Is there a way to get my standard WinPE3x Bootable USB stick support SDHC? I would think using the DISM tool to load the SDHC inf driver would be a start? But I am curious if anyone else has done this before. I would like to use an SDHC card to store backups of my HardDrive and WinPE3x does not see an SDHC card by default. Thank you in advance for any help you can provide!  \n\nHere is the SDHC controller type integrated into my Laptop:  \nDeviceID: PCI\\\\VEN_1180\\\u0026DEV_0822\\\u0026SUBSYS_833810F7\\\u0026REV_21\\\\4\\\u002631FC8C23\\\u00260\\\u002602F0  \nDriver: C:\\\\Windows\\\\system32\\\\DRIVERS\\\\sdbus.sys   \n"
