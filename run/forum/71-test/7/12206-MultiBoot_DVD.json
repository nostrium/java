      "content": "Hi  \nThanxs for the suggestion @florin91.....as i have already done the ***Multiboot Sardu + G4D*** on my ***USB*** including adding of the PendriveLinux website ISOes  \n\nAlso thank u for the hint @Scorpy on making a ***Sardu DVDR*** , as i have already done that too.  \n\nNow coming to the ***G4D DVDR*** . I have managed to do the G4D DVDR like in the above first post. But the problem i am facing is this;  \nI tried the G4D DVDR on real pc environment. It doesnt work.   \nAfter making the G4D.iso , i first tried the iso in VMWare and everything works nicely. Than i used Imageburn and burnt the iso to DVD-RW (as B4 i had burnt with Nero and it had not worked, similar like this). Than i tried this burnt DVD-RW in VMware and it works well. But when i try this same DVD-RW by rebooting real pc, it just doesnt work. I get a xo_ blinking screen and nothing happens. Really dont know what to do. As i cant use it at all.   \n\nNow i dont know if it doesnt work bcos i have an external DVD writer connected via usb. I do not have an internal dvd writer/ dvd rom. My dvd writer is an external usb one. In the BIOS this external dvd writer is the first boot device and this external writer works if i boot from the sardu DVDR, [Easyboot bootable DVDR](http://www.ezbsystems.com/ultraiso/ \"External link\"), and any other bootable dvds like WinXP, or Win 7, it works.   \n\nEDIT:- I made a G4D on a CD, since i have a internal CDRom, when i boot from real PC environment, it still doesnt work. Gives the same error as from a DVDR. So the problem is not with the DVD writer, as it doesnt work on the CD also.   \nSo cant understand why if i make a **G4D Bootable DVDR** it doesnt work. :wink:   \nAny suggestions would be really helpful.....   \n"

      "content": "Hi  \nManaged to get G4D DVDR like the above first post working on my real PC environment and just thought of sharing my experience here in case somebody else has the same problem like mine, as they will save time..... :wink:   \n\nTo recap i had managed to get G4D DVDR working in VMWare but it was not working on a real PC environment. The issue at hand was this:  \n\nWhile making the **G4D DVDR** , everything was okay except the placement of the **menu.lst** and **submenu.lst**. Atleast i think that is what was the problem. I had followed the same procedure of making and placing the menu.lst \\\u0026 submenu.lst as i had done for my **G4D multiboot USB** ......ie.   \nmenu.lst was placed **\\\\menu.lst**   \nsubmenu.lst was placed **\\\\menu\\\\submenu.lst**   \nSo in other words the menu.lst was in the root of the DVDR and the submenu.lst was in a \"menu folder\". This is how i had done for my G4D on USB and it works fine.  \nBut the same didnt work for the G4D DVDR. So now i got the ***G4D DVDR working*** by placing both the menu.lst and submenu.lst in the root of the DVDR and accordingly modifying the menu.lst \\\u0026 submenu.lst to point to each other.  \n**\\\\menu.lst**  \n**\\\\submenu.lst**  \n\nPS:- Was wondering if there is a Thank You section here in bootland. Any link  \n\n:smile:   \n"

I just had a notion of \"i wish it was possible to do something like this\" .After joining here i realized that this notion was a hard fact reality already in use for many years.  \nAnd due to the easy methods, super easy tutorials, explanations, information from this forum was able to make a ***G4D + Sardu USB, Sardu DVDR, G4D DVDR.***   \n\nSo my ***THANKS*** also goes to all the people who gave me different advice, tips etc like ***Wile E. Warrigal*** ***\\\u0026*** ***Zug*** (for lots of tips), ***Wonko The Sane***, ***Pazzie*** , ***maanu*** , ***Chaos_Cubed*** , ***SuPaNooB***   \nOn the Live XP project i would like to than ***Lancelot*** and ***Amalux*** for their valuable advice and tutorial.  \n.......m sorry if i missed some one.... :wink:   \n"

      "content": "Hi Wonko  \nIt\u0027s working now.....i tested the G4D DVDR on real pc envir.....no problem now.....ie after rectifying the placement of menu.lst and submenu.lst......   \nThanks for the reminder about the lower and upper case. I had done that first, since i had come across that same issue about the file names in upper/lower case when i was doing an [***Easyboot***](http://www.ezbsystems.com/easyboot/index.html \"External link\") ***bootable DVDR*** . So had applied that here. But from what i think that the problem in this case, was that the submenu.lst was inside a menu folder. Now after placing the submenu.lst in the root of the DVDR, everything has worked fine.  \n\nThough not much to think about, as the G4D DVDR works fine now, my only observation which i find strange is that with the incorrect placement of the submenu.lst, the G4D DVDR was working alrite in VMWare, but was failing in real pc environment. Yup i know that what works in VMWare does not have to work in real PC and vice versa, but it is strange that the real PC envirnmt culdnt find the submenu.lst inside the menu folder when the VMWare could easliy find submenu.lst in the menu folder. :wink:   \n"
