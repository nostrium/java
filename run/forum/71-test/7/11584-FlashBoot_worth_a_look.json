      "content": "\u003e Can you give more details on what scenario was not working and why?\nNo idea about the why. The USB-Sticks got always detected as USB-FDD. Trying to boot from them always returned an error that no system could be found.  \nOnly the one Stick which got detected as USB-HDD booted fine.  \n\n\u003e What OS, fat16/32/NTFS, what contents, which systems, what were symptoms of sticks that would not boot, etc.\nI used a Ram-Boot NaughtyPE (WinPE 1.x) I tested about every single combination of options of the different programs, except messing with geometry.  \nDrive got partitioned as Floppy, Zip, HDD with 1 partition and HDD with 2 partition, filesystems where FAT16, FAT32 and NTFS.  \n\n\u003e I have had a quick look at it and it seems to use a 2nd stage loader before it loads the main OS...\nYep, looks that way.  \nBut loading this loader, seems to be already one step more, than what previously happened.  \nMaybe installing a bootloader in MBR is already enough of a trick?  \n\n:smile:   \n"
