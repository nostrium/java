      "content": "I made a VistaPE flash drive and then added on Ubuntu and a couple antivirus rescue discs to make a multiboot USB. Now I want to make DVDs of the USB, but I can\u0027t figure out how to do it.  \n\nThe problem is that I can\u0027t figure out a way to make a DVD bootable. I tried running grubinst on a virtual floppy drive and using an ISO creator to copy the boot image to an ISO containing all the files from the usb drive. That didn\u0027t work. It eventually loads a grub command line, instead of loading from my menu.lst file. If I try running the commands from that menu.lst file, it won\u0027t boot anything. Then I tried using ImgBurn to extract a boot image and then saving that as an ISO. That didn\u0027t work. It just gets me to a black screen with an unblinking cursor. I\u0027ve been testing it out in Virtual Box, not on a proper DVD, but that shouldn\u0027t make a difference.  \n\nPlease help!   \n"
