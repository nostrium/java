Try, learn, have fun!   \n"

Actually, with new RMPrepUSB v2.0.734 it is even simpler.  \n\nCreate a bootable USB drive as USB HDD and click the Install Grub Bootloader button. Now just add your iso\u0027s and the menu.lst.  \n\nYou can download the MS WAIK to make WinPE.  \n\nLet us know what you want to boot and have a go!  \n\nA lot depends on the BIOS in your system - if it doesn\u0027t work on one system, try another - it may work on that!   \n"
