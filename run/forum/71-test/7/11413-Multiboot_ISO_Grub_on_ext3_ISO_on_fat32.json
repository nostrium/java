Sooo....uh, I guess I agree with the last post for the same reason (the point?), but different methodology.\nI will repeat (just in case).  \nANY \"normal\" NT based system will see most (please read as \"ALL\") USB sticks as \"Removable\" device, and will ONLY mount and let access one single partition on it.  \nThis is INDEPENDENT from the filesystem the UNSEEN/UNMOUNTABLE under windows partition is formatted with.  \nAny \"normal\" DOS based system will NOT access a \"hidden\" partition, and will only access unhidden ones, and this also has NO relation with the filesystem the hidden partition is formatted with.  \ngrub4dos can access ANY partition, even hidden ones, as long as they are formatted as FAT12, 16, 32, NTFS or EXT2/3.  \nSo, using Ext3 is only a more complex than needed approach for resolving the posted problem.  \n\n![:thumbsup:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/thumbsup.gif)  \nWonko   \n"

Nonetheless, my statements were inaccurate anyhow.   \n\nBy where ever, I was referring to a non-native grub boot. In that case, the boot sector isn\u0027t necessarily the MBR, and grub can call grub, so to speak. That can lead to lots of options if you are willing to use ext3 (or almost any linux filesystem).   \n\nSorry for the confusion...you are clearly more accurate (and, of course, the response is appropriate).   \n"
