I can\u0027t do that.  \n\nHow can I recover that?  \n\nI didn\u0027t make a backup. Sucks.  \n\nI checked many data recovery software, they can\u0027t fix this problem, like recuva, diskgetor, etc. they can\u0027t run in Mac   \n"

You can transfer a big library without buying it but it\u0027s tedious. There are others out ther in the $15-$40 price range, but I haven\u0027t tried them. I bet there are such things for the Mac.   \n"
