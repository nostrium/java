I have all these OS (bootable isos) and Diag tools(also bootable iso\u0027s) on a network drive. I would like to create 1 boot cd to insert into a PC that would look to that network drives folder then let me type in a command to load which ever ISO I want. That way I wouldn\u0027t have to hunt for all these different cds when ever I want to install a particular version of windows.   \n\nI am not really picky on the method just the general idea. 1 boot cd to run any bootable ISO on a network drive  \n\nI don\u0027t know if that\u0027s possible or not but it seems like it should be, a kick in the right direction would be much appreciated   \n"

I went through and read some forums and I get that each ISO is a bit different and may require a different boot loader, so let me simplify this then. I dont need this to be an end all be all just something to simplify my life; a net effect is what I am going for. Something that covers a high percentage but probably not everything or maybe not even a majority.   \n\nSo for my purposes Lets just say its the X.iso is one of the following :  \n\nWindows XP , Windows Vista and Windows 7. (all the various versions of those OS\u0027s 64bit, ultimate... whatever)   \n"
