      "content": "Hi, I set out with the same goal of consolidating numerous discs to one USB. Evenually settled on two, one built with RMPrepUSB, that has my windows install discs and the other with MultiBootISOs, available here [http://www.pendrivel...-multiboot-usb/](http://www.pendrivelinux.com/boot-multiple-iso-from-usb-multiboot-usb/ \"External link\") . Just edit the menu.lst to add and remove stuff. There is a section at Bootland where people list working menu entries. Otherwise trial and error usually wins in the end. Goodluck.   \n"

Not sure why this only happens on some builds tho.   \n"

      "content": "The difference is not GRUB4DOS in particular, it is that the .ISOs are not physical disc drives attached to the computer. GRUB4DOS (or MEMDISK) can hook the **BIOS INTerrupt 0x13** service and provide the virtual disk to consumers, but Linux is not (and Windows is not) an INT 0x13 consumer. Linux has drivers which look for CD/DVD drives. Since your .ISO is just a region of memory, there isn\u0027t a corresponding CD/DVD drive to be found. You could try posting a directory listing of one of these .ISOs and it might be obvious whether or not everything you need is contained in the kernel+initrd.   \n"
