      "content": "Chenall\u0027s NTBOOT is a grub4dos script which modifies a BCD loaded onto a virtual floppy disk.\n\nUsing NTBOOT, we can boot from a variety of Windows PE and WindowsToGo VHDs (Win7/8/8.1/10)\n\nIt chainloads to bootmgr first and then bootmgr uses the BCD which it has modified so that the path of the VHD file is correct.\n\nHowever, when I tried directly booting a Windows 8 and Windows 10 VHD from an Easy2Boot USB drive which I recently made with my Windows 10 host system, I found that I got a BSOD 0xc00000bb BCD error from both VHDs, even though the same VHDs worked fine on a different Easy2Boot USB drive that was made using WIn8.1.\n\nI traced the problem to the version of bootmgr that I was using. Easy2Boot copies bootmgr from your host system at C:\\\\windows\\\\Boot\\\\PCAT to the Easy2Boot \\\\_ISO\\\\e2b\\\\grub\\\\DPMS\\\\NTBOOT.MOD folder when you run the Make_e2B-USB_Drive.cmd script. The version on my Windows 10 system seems to give this BCD error with NTBOOT. I have found a few different versions of bootmgr and only the Windows 10 C:\\\\windows\\\\Boot\\\\PCAT version seems to give the problem.\n\n1. bootmgr 10-07-2015 395268 CRC32\u003d45B6D6D7 - WINDOWS 10 version\n\n2. bootmgr 22-08-2013 427680 CRC32\u003d87783488\n\n3. bootmgr 25-07-2012 398156 CRC32\u003d4B1A74EF\n\n4. bootmgr 14-06-2014 404250 CRC32\u003dCB810D1B\n\nOnly #1 gives the bad BCD problem with NTBOOT.\n\nSo it seems that there is something different about the Windows 10 version of bootmgr?\n\n"
