It means**\u0027install.wim\u0027** also contains some special UEFI files which extract into the Installation Drive during installation and play an important role when System boot from the Installation Drive in UEFI mode.   \n\nSo can anybody please tell me about the **Special UEFI files (both x86 and x64)** in **EFI folder, \u0027boot.wim\u0027 and \u0027install.wim\u0027** which allow a **OS (x86/x64)** to boot and install into their respective **UEFI firmware (x86/x64)** based PCs.  \n\nI know my thinking may be foolish, stupid and non-sense.

You also break your ability to upgrade from a previous os.  \n\u003e You can hack some files and get it to work, but it\u0027s not advised. You also need to edit the normal legacy bcd to point at the x64 setup wim so users can run the repair option if their computer gets messed up.  \n\u003e\n\u003e I mostly leave them in the typical format because there are just too many downsides to trying to hybridize the setup.
