      "content": "hi friske,  \n\nwhat is \"i driver\"?  \n\nHORM \u003d Hibernate Once Resume Many  \n\nso I think that means you only hibernate when you have the set-up you want to resume on every start up. Im not certain about this though but I am certain the the \"O\" in HORM stands for \"Once\"  \n\nalso see this post about your error message: [http://reboot.pro/to...xe/#entry196982](http://reboot.pro/topic/20910-digital-signature-of-winloadexe/#entry196982 \"\")   \n"
