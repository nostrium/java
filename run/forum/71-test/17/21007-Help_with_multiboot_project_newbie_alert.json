      "content": "If this is in the wrong section, I do apologize!\n\nI had a computer issue a month ago and fortunately a rescue disk helped! Since then, I have wanted to make my own custom multiboot rescue disk/usb.\n\nI have spent weeks looking at all sorts of forums and trying all kinds of tools (SARDU, SharpBoot, XBoot, YUMI, etc) to make the multiboot compilation. They all have their pluses and minuses. I plan on having Windows 10PE (which I made using winbuilder). A Xubuntu live cd, Bitdefender, Comodo, Eset, and possibly Kaspersky rescue cds as well. Some tools get Bitdefender to work but end up with Eset not working and vice versa.\n\nI ended up taking the general layout from the ISO that winbuilder makes with Grub4Dos and GfxBoot. I was then able to use a lot of the syntax that WinsetupFromUSB uses to get Linux isos to boot. It all works on the USB drive. But when I try to boot the ISO image there are issues.\n\nThe menu loads fine. I but when I try to launch any of the antivirus rescue cds I get this.\n\n```\n224 (HEX:0xE0)\nFilesystem type is udf, partition type 0x00\n224 (HEX:0xE0)\nWarning: PARTITION TABLE 4 IN BIOS DEVICE 224 IS ALREADY IN USE!\n\nTo prevent possible data loss will not continue further \n```\n\nThe fact that it works on the thumb drive is great but it would be nice if it worked as an ISO image too. I am new to all of this so if I missed something just ask. I am sure I am missing something simple that will fix this that I just cannot figure out.\n\n**Edited by Shoshi, 23 February 2016 - 12:04 AM.**\n"

I do not get the error on the USB drive, Only when I packaged it back into an ISO does the error happen. I m a newbie and I do understand that there is a file format difference between the USB drive (mine is formatted fat32) and the format of an ISO file.\n\nIs the error because the ISO image does not have the 4th partition? I guess I am confused about what changes I need to make to get it to work like it does on the USB and as an ISO file as well,\n\n**Edited by Shoshi, 23 February 2016 - 01:33 AM.**\n"

I have tried both Sardu, xboot, and sharpboot to make iso files, but they fail to make the ISOS from Bitdefender, ESET, or Kaspersky work.

I just know that the G4D command arguments I am using are not ideal and could probably be adjusted to work in both a USB and an ISO.

WinSetupFromUSB (there is a hint in the name!!!!) is not designed to run from a CD.\n\nWhat you may find useful is the ISOBOOT code used in E2B.\n\nFor instance, you can boot from the eset-sysrescue.1.0.9.0.enu.iso file in E2B by holding down the SHIFT key when you press ENTER.\n\nThis makes E2B use ISOBOOT instead of partnew.\n\nThe code used by ISOBOOT can be found at \\\\_ISO\\\\e2b\\\\grub\\\\ISOBOOT.g4b\n\nIt works by recognising the file name of the ISO file.\n\nThere is a list of ISOs which work with ISOBOOT [here](http://www.easy2boot.com/add-payload-files/list-of-tested-payload-files/ \"External link\").\n\nWith the latest version of E2B 1.77, if you convert it to a CD, it should automatically run ISOBOOT (though I haven\u0027t tested that).\n\nOr you can use the ISOBOOT.g4b file, or pull out the code from it.\n\nISOBOOT is for linux ISOs, though it could be adapted to recognise other ISOs.\n\ne.g. if you had the E2B files on your USB drive or CD, you could have a menu\n\nset ISOC\u003d/ISO/someiso.iso\n\ncall /_ISO/e2b/grub/isoboot.g4b\n\nAs I said, you should use a utility that is designed to generate an ISO file if you want to use their menus.

How hard would it be to do this?\n\nThe issue is different.\n\nThere is no problem whatsoever in chainloading either syslinux or GRUB2 from grub4dos (they are as well linux kernels), the issue comes after, when these tools will look for their configuration files, such as syslinux.cfg or grub.cfg.\n\nThings that may go wrong:\n\n1) the configuration file is not found\n\n2) the configuration file is found but it is written in such a way that assumes something about it\u0027s own locations/paths and devices.\n\nTo remain in grub4dos, to make an example, this:\n\ntitle my first example\n\nroot (hd0,0)\n\nchainloader /myexample\n\nwill work OK, but ONLY if the file is in the device mapped as (hd0,0).\n\nThis one:\n\ntitle my second example\n\nfind --set-root /myexample\n\nchainloader /myexample\n\nwill work on \\*any\\* device.\n\nSo you need not only to chainload the \"original\" loader, but EITHER make sure that it can find its own configuration file ***and*** that the configuration files is \"portable\" OR duplicate the \"original\" loader and the configuration file on the writable media you are booting from ***and*** modify the configuration file in such a way that it finds and boot the target.\n\nIn some cases this is very easy, in some other cases it can be extremely difficult or impossible.\n\n![:duff:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/duff.gif)\n\nWonko\n\n"

Since then, I have wanted to make my own custom multiboot rescue disk/usb.\n\nI have spent weeks looking at all sorts of forums and trying all kinds of tools (SARDU, SharpBoot, XBoot, YUMI, etc) to make the multiboot compilation. They all have their pluses and minuses. I plan on having Windows 10PE (which I made using winbuilder). A Xubuntu live cd, Bitdefender, Comodo, Eset, and possibly Kaspersky rescue cds as well. Some tools get Bitdefender to work but end up with Eset not working and vice versa.\n\nI ended up taking the general layout from the ISO that winbuilder makes with Grub4Dos and GfxBoot. I was then able to use a lot of the syntax that WinsetupFromUSB uses to get Linux isos to boot. It all works on the USB drive. But when I try to boot the ISO image there are issues.\n\nThe menu loads fine. I but when I try to launch any of the antivirus rescue cds I get this.\n\n```\n224 (HEX:0xE0)\nFilesystem type is udf, partition type 0x00\n224 (HEX:0xE0)\nWarning: PARTITION TABLE 4 IN BIOS DEVICE 224 IS ALREADY IN USE!\n\nTo prevent possible data loss will not continue further \n```\n\nThe fact that it works on the thumb drive is great but it would be nice if it worked as an ISO image too.

(not necessarily this one, but maybe the \"other\" one using casper is bootable like that or maybe it accepts correctly the cheatcodes)\n\nAnother (not really safe/tested or recommended) approach could be that of having (say) a caspe1 and a caspe2 folder and rename the folder at boot time to casper from grub4dos.\n\n![:duff:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/duff.gif)\n\nWonko\n\n"

CD, and I have also made a Plop!+grub4dos CD which will automatically boot to USB even if the system does not support USB booting.\n\nIt is quite rare these days to find a system that does not support USB booting.

RMPrepUSB uses a new version of grubinst.exe which creates a more compatible MBR boot sector than older versions.\n\n2. You can install the boot code to the MBR and PBR or both. Some systems boot directly to the PBR.\n\n3. RMPrepUSB can add a 2nd small partition (Boot as HDD C: option). This makes some BIOSes boot the USB drive as a hard disk instead of booting it as a floppy and hanging with a flashing cursor.\n\nFor E2B, I install to MBR and PBR and create the 2nd small hidden partition.\n\nI also use a recent version of grub4dos 0.4.6a. I recommend using it because it has more features (e.g. understands UDF ISOs and has a USB 2.0 rd/wr driver + GPT support + debug features and new commands, etc. etc.). Also, if you do find a bug, it can be reported and fixed easily. Any bugs in old versions will obviously not be fixed and you will just be asked to use the latest version. However, bear in mind that many versions are buggy, so don\u0027t just use the latest version of 0.4.6a (or 0.4.5c) and think that is the \u0027released\u0027 version.\n\nAny version used by E2B or RMPrepUSB in released versions (i.e. ones not ending in a lower case letter) should be OK.\n\n"
