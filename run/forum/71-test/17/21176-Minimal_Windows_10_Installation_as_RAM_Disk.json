Are there any Czech-fluent reboot.pro people reading this message? There\u0027s a fellow who has expressed an interest in paying for help, but after more than 4 hours of excruciating Google Translate interactions, the language barrier has proven to be too much for me to handle without a human, bilingual intermediary.\n3. Has anyone ever taken an HDD image of a Windows 10 installation and managed to boot it as a RAM disk, from GRUB4DOS? (Or at least from a BIOS-based boot environment, since GRUB4DOS can chain to other such environments.)\n\nThank you for your time and have a happy all the things.\n\n"

      "content": "No Czech either, but I would also suggest the VHD approach. I have seen posts here about converting a running system to VHD, and also booting a vhd.\n\nI also know that easy2boot can take a ptn \"image\" (i.e. a partion image) and pass it to grub4dos to load into RAM to boot. Sounds like some pointes to go by - and yes - remote support is tough enough without any language barrier.\n\nBest of luck!\n\n"
