      "content": "Hey guys so I have a problem with my pc that stops it from booting into windows. So thought I could use HBCD to fix the issue right? Well this was the only Windows-operating system in the house. I tried to install HBCD via Unetbootin on Linux, changed the isolinux.cfg to syslinux.cfg and copied it to the USB\u0027s root. Except when I put it into my pc that needs to get fixed, it won\u0027t boot on the key. This is really weird cause it will boot on Ubuntu, Windows recovery drive and Linux Mint live USBs but not into Hiren\u0027s... ANy ideas on how to fix this?\n\n"
