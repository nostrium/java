There is an option of ubuntu and windows 7, so i selected the windows 7 and it goes to windows logo screen and finally the login screen with the username on it. But then i still can\u0027t login by either leaving the password blank or typing random in it.\n\ndid i miss anything? :\n\nplease help.\n\nthanks!\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n"

      "content": "Assuming you are using KonBoot 2.x, I would guess that the problem is caused by booting to grub first.\n\nIs the Windows 7 MBR booting or UEFI booting?\n\nI would suggest contacting the company that supports it because they offer full support.\n\nThe alternative would be to remove the grub bootloader and re-install a standard bootmgr bootloader using the bootsect utility.\n\n"

      "content": "Hi Steve,\n\nthank you for your reply!\n\ni thought so that the kon-boot process is interrupted because the PC load multiboot grub option.\n\nit didn\u0027t somehow get through into the windows 7.\n\nso now the question is, how do i add kon-boot to one of boot option in that grub, or should i maybe edit the windows 7 boot commands? and add konboot into the commands?\n\nsorry i\u0027m really clueless about this, and i think the PC owner whose PC i tried to get in is a lot smarter than me on this haha\n\nthanks!\n\n"

      "content": "I think if you add KonBoot to the grub2 menu, then KonBoot will reboot from the hard disk again and load the grub2 menu again.\n\nAs I said, either re-install a bootmgr boot sector or ask KonBoot.\n\nYou can boot from a WinPE USB drive to run [bootsect](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd744577%28v\u003dws.10%29.aspx?f\u003d255\u0026MSPPError\u003d-2147217396 \"External link\") - you will probably need the /nt60 /MBR /ALL switches.\n\nYou will lose the Ubuntu boot and it may give you an unbootable system though!\n\nMaybe an alternative solution would be easier - e.g. passpass?\n\n"

      "content": "I didn\u0027t realize there was an update to KonBoot so I just picked it up.\n\nI created a UEFI compatible USB drive with KonBoot install program. Then I used Steve\u0027s MPIToolPack\u0027s MakePartImage link and pointed to this USB drive. I answered the prompts taking the defaults and had an .imPTN ready to throw on my Easy2Boot USB stick. I tried it out on a CSM bootabler system and it works like a charm. I don\u0027t happen to have a EFI bootable system handy just now but I am sure it would work for it too.\n\nThe only \"issue\" I had using it on my home laptop is that the bootable SATA drive is an MSATA stick and KonBoot would not find it as the bootable media since it is not the first SATA drive. I had to go into the computers BIOS and shut off the other SATA disk from being available to force the MSATA drive to appear as the lone drive. It worked after that. It\u0027s an unusual situation but bound to turn up once in a while.\n\n"
