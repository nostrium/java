      "content": "Hi folks,  \n\nNot sure if I\u0027m posting this in the right location, so sorry if this is wrong?  \n\nCan anyone recommend a good open source imaging tool - one that can be run from a Live CD, that is capable of cloning a Windows XP hard disk to an image? I\u0027ve looked at CloneZilla which works OK but it doesn\u0027t appear to allow resizing of partitions when a restore is performed?  \n\nWe are trying to look at a way to achieve the same as is possible with Symantec Ghost Enterprise v11.5, but without the Ghost licensing costs ;-)  \n\nAny suggestions are most welcomed!  \n\nThanks,  \n\nGregor.   \n"
