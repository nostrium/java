      "content": "Hi all,  \n\nI am trying to figure out if any one has a way I can take a bunch of CD ISO files and a 8+gig USB memory key and create my own little tool that will allow me to flash multiple BIOS files for multiple computers all off 1 USB key?  \n\nI have been looking at using GRUB4DOS, ghost and a few other tools to see if I can come up with some thing that will allow me to make my job easier (and learn some new tricks while I am at it).  \n\nAny suggestions and help would be appreciated.   \n"

      "content": "Not sure to fully understand the question, but if you have few bootable CDROM (or file images of them) and want to copy all of them on a USB key to be able to boot any of them, you may want to try the new [Gujin](http://gujin.org \"External link\") (version 2.8.1).  \nBasically, you format the USB key once so that it can boot the system \\[1\\], and then copy your \\*.iso files on the USB key.  \nAt reboot time, you will be presented with a menu showing each iso file and asking you which one you want to boot - there isn\u0027t any configuration needed, filenames with iso extension are automagically detected.  \nIt should work for all El-Torito bootable CDROM, either in no-emulation mode or emulating any kind of floppy, as long as the booted system do not specifically ask for the content of the CDROM (because files are now on the USB key). If your CDROMs images are just for re-flashing the BIOS it will probably just use the BIOS to access the disk and Gujin should work.  \nYou can also copy bootable floppy or bootable USB disk images onto your USB key (with extension .bdi or .img) and you will be able to boot them too. The BIOS disk emulation will be read/write if Gujin is allowed to write to disk, that is one tick-box in its setup screen that you can see at boot time.  \nThis version of Gujin is really new so you may find few problems, please report success/failure!  \n\n\\[1\\] To format the USB key so that it can boot the system is easier under Linux than under Windows.  \nFor Linux you have to find which disk is your USB key, for instance /dev/sdf, and then type on a command line \"umount /dev/sdf\\* \\\u0026\\\u0026 sudo ./gujin /dev/sdf\"; the executable can be found at sourceforge in the install-2.8.1.tar.gz file.  \nFor Windows you have to use the device images USB1Gb.img, USB2Gb.img ... USB8Gb.img (in install-2.8.1.tar.gz) depending on the USB size, as described in [Gujin home page](http://gujin.org \"External link\") (Gujin is mostly developped on Linux).  \nYou should better begin with a 1 or 2 Gbyte USB key, 4 and 8 Gbytes uses FAT32 and may not boot on you PCs.  \n\nCheers!   \n"
