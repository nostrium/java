      "content": "\u003e [http://www.plop.at/e...er.html#hotkeys](http://www.plop.at/en/bootmanager.html#hotkeys \"External link\")\n\nThank you.  \n\nI had problem since I used an external keyboard/mouse through an USB hub, which is not supported by PLoP. Otherwise even with the internal keyboard, I have to press \"Ctrl\" before pressing \u0027u\u0027 in order to get the prompt for pressing \"n\" for searching for USB device. It is weird since as if you have to press Ctrl-U. Afterwards the \u0027n\u0027 key works well, and from the USB device (manufacturer name) I can get to boot the correct USB key.  \n\nNote : this key is not detected by BIOS at boot time, so thanks to PLoP I can even boot from it, otherwise it would be impossible.   \n"
