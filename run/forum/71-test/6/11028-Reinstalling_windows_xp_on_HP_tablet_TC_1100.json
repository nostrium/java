      "content": "Hi,  \n\nRecently I have installed windows 7 on my HP tablet pc tc 1100. I think it is a little slow so I want to reinstall windows xp on my HP tablet pc tc 1100.  \n\nBut there is no cd drive in my pc, so the only chance that I can get it back is using booting from usb like what I did to install windows 7 before. But now, I created a usb hiren boot, tested with other PC, it works during booting. But for my HP, it does not work. Off course, I am sure to choose booting with usb is the first priority.   \n\nSo, could you give me an advice on how to reinstall my windows xp on my hp tc 1100? I dont have an external cd drive.   \n\nThanks in advance   \n"
