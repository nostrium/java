Look in the BIOS Setup menu for a \u0027Fixed Disk\u0027 or \u0027Hard Disk\u0027 setting for USB booting.  \nUse the 2PTN switch in RMPrepUSB (new version out today v2.0.730).  \n\nTry making the same USB pen as a FreeDOS bootable pen using FreeDos files which come with RMPrepUSB - does it boot as A: or C: ???  \n\nWhat size is the USB pen? Try 2GB+.   \nS   \n"
