      "content": "This is a computer I built myself, a athlon 750 with a ga-7ixe MoBo and a radeon 8500. My computer knowledge is moderate but there is more I don\u0027t know then what I know, I am sure.  \n\nI was using winxp, I set up my system to duel boot with win98 for older games. One day winXP mysteriously died, it just stops loading at certain stage with no error message. So now I am stuck running win98. This is problematic, especially since win98 only recognizes part of my ram. I lost my XP cd awhile back and my cd burner no longer will burn (maybe because my purchased burn CD\u0027s are too new for it?)  \n\n\\* \\* \\*   \n\nMy hard drive, which is partitioned into two equal parts, is nearly full. But I bought two 8GB flash drives (can\u0027t find one at the moment) I was thinking I could install a OS on each of the flash drives, so that I could change OS by simply changing the flash drive. I also figured I could use a ISO of winXP a friend gave me from the flash drive to repair my winXP.  \n\n\\* \\* \\*   \n\nI understand winXP and win98 don\u0027t really get along duel booted and win98 can cause winXP to go corrupt sometimes, any of you hear this too?  \n\n\\* \\* \\*   \n\nI\u0027ve been told by some that lots of rewriting on a flash drive like if I were to use it as a swap drive/for \"virtual ram\" would wear it out fast. But I understand flash drives are solid state and this doesn\u0027t make sense to me. My PC friend who also seems pretty knowledgable (more then me) thinks the same thing. He says that hes had a flash drive for a number of years now (I think he said 5), even dropping it in the rain and using it to get many midi files and it hasnt had any issues. That he understood flash drives to be longer lasting the hard drives, but maybe that depends on the level of quality too.  \n\nWhat have you guys heard about flash drives and multiple rewrites? Please back up what ever you say with some evidence please, a webpage link or something, that way I can be sure that your belief is true and not conjecture or hearsay.  \n\n\\* \\* \\*   \n\nOk back to putting a OS or two on flash drives. I have so many questions in this area it is hard to know where to start. So lets start with the toughest and most important issue.  \n\nMy MoBo has a USB boot option, but its USB FDD, which I guess stands for floppy disk drive. How can I make the MoBo think my flash drive is a floppy drive but use the whole 8GB?   \n\nThere was this program someone linked me to [http://www.plop.at/en/bootmanager.html](http://www.plop.at/en/bootmanager.html \"External link\"), but seems it would require I boot from a floppy or CD rom to then boot from the flash drive. One too many steps to happen every time I load IMO.  \n\nI found this website, [http://www.bootdisk.com/pendrive.htm](http://www.bootdisk.com/pendrive.htm \"External link\"), but I find it difficult to determine which method listed would help me, if any.  \n\n\\* \\* \\*   \n\nI also am wondering about multiple OS on one flash disk and how you can switch one to another as for what is set for booting from. About programs like this [http://chameleon.osx86.hu/](http://chameleon.osx86.hu/ \"External link\") or this [http://sourceforge.net/projects/btmgr](http://sourceforge.net/projects/btmgr \"External link\").   \n\nI wonder how you determine what formate a drive is in, win98 doesn\u0027t tell you just by right clicking the drive in properties.   \n\nWell thats more then enough questions for now ![:thumbsup:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/thumbsup.gif) Thank you ahead of time for your help.   \n"

      "content": "Let\u0027s tackle one problem at the time, OK?  \n\n**1)** there is NO problem whatsoever in***dual*** booting Windows 98 and XP (of course if you call it ***duel*** booting you create an unfriendly climate in the PC that may be the cause of the problem ![:thumbsup:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/thumbsup.gif))  \n**2)** The fact that USB flash sticks are \"solid state\" means that the y are \"solid state\" NOT that they are \"solid\".  \nAny flash based devices has practically unlimited reading cycles but a determined number of write cycles.  \nThere is NO reliable and updated literature on the topic, the general idea is 100.000 write cycles, but this was (if ever) true for early generation of Flash based memory, the actual figure now is probably higher.  \n**BUT** , you miss the fact that some filesystems (NTFS or any semi-journaled or journaled filesystem) and some particular OS files (typically pagefile) are accessed and written to hundred of times, without you knowing it.  \nAs I see it running a system on a USB Flash device as an everyday OS on a NTFS partition without implementing particular workarounds and \"tricks\" means frying the device in a short number of days, maybe weeks.  \nBesides, you have to take into account that an average USB stick has a throughput between 12 and 20 Mb/s, averaging at the best 15 Mb/s, which is roughly 1/10th of a \"normal\" internal ATA 133 disk or sata I one, your system will be SLOW.  \nIf you use FAT16 or FAT32 it is likely that the stick will last years.  \nDon\u0027t even think of putting a pagefile on the stick, and DEFINITELY NOT a growing one.  \nModern USB stick controllers use internal wear leveling algorithms that contribute to extend the expected life of a device very, very considerably.  \nAs often happens in htis sad world, you usually get what you pay for, a top-speed-with-wear-leveling USB stick will behave MUCH better both in speed and duration, that a no-name cheap stick.  \nRead a bit around (not necessarily \"USB stick\" relatred, more generally about flash based storeage devices:  \n[http://en.wikipedia....ki/Flash_memory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_memory \"External link\")  \n[http://www.boot-land...?showtopic\u003d8757](http://www.boot-land.net/forums/index.php?showtopic\u003d8757 \"External link\")  \n[http://www.boot-land...?...ic\u003d9615\\\u0026hl\u003d](http://www.boot-land.net/forums/index.php?showtopic\u003d9615\u0026hl\u003d \"External link\")  \n[http://www.storagese...-endurance.html](http://www.storagesearch.com/ssdmyths-endurance.html \"External link\")  \n[http://www.esacademy...sh/lifetime.htm](http://www.esacademy.com/faq/docs/flash/lifetime.htm \"External link\")  \n[http://en.wikipedia..../Wear_levelling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wear_levelling \"External link\")  \n[http://www.corsair.c...ar_leveling.pdf](http://www.corsair.com/_faq/FAQ_flash_drive_wear_leveling.pdf \"External link\")  \n[http://www.flashmemo...1_F2B_Roman.pdf](http://www.flashmemorysummit.com/English/Collaterals/Proceedings/2009/20090811_F2B_Roman.pdf \"External link\")  \n\n**3)** There are workarounds for booting on motherboards that ONLY accept FD devices:  \n[http://www.boot-land...?showtopic\u003d9460](http://www.boot-land.net/forums/index.php?showtopic\u003d9460 \"External link\")  \n[http://www.boot-land...?showtopic\u003d7932](http://www.boot-land.net/forums/index.php?showtopic\u003d7932 \"External link\")  \nthough be warned that while most motherboards will accept any size of the unpartitioned FD devices, many will have a 512 Mb limit and a few actually expect a 1,44 Mb floppy size.  \nYour Mileage May VARY.  \n\n**4)** You will need some more effort than \"right clicking a drive icon\", but you will also need to study a bit the matter.  \nHere is some initial reading:  \n[http://www.ranish.com/part/primer.htm](http://www.ranish.com/part/primer.htm \"External link\")  \n[http://www.pcguide.c...f/hdd/index.htm](http://www.pcguide.com/ref/hdd/index.htm \"External link\")  \n\n![:whistling:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/happy22.gif)  \n\njaclaz   \n"

      "content": "\u003e Do disk hard drives have a limited number of writes too?\nNO, they are of course subject to wear but they have not the same kind of \"limited number of write cycles\".  \nThey are NOT \"eternal\", but they DO NOT wera because of writes, they usually wear \"mechanically\".  \n\n\u003e My friend also mentioned a upcoming hard drive that was entirely solid state.

But it might be slower in other ways, how might I compare speeds, got a program link for that?\nIf you had taken your time to read the links you actually asked for, such solid state hard drives are on the market and in use since a fair bit of time.  \n\nYou completely fail to understand that between the actual device and the actual motherboard there is a connection through a DATA BUS, that in the case of USB drives is a (very, very tight) bottleneck, while on internal high speed bus, like SATA, it is not.  \n\nSSD\u0027s are meant as replacement for INTERNAL hard disk drives.  \n\nANY \"high-speed\" device connected to a \"low-speed\" bus (such as USB) will obviously give you \"low-speed\".   \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n\u003e Could I possible assign all temporary drive usage including swap drive/\"virtual ram\" to the actual hard drive and just run the OS off the flash drive so that writing to the flash drive is limited to updates and such? The three OS I want to use are win98, XP, and linux (still trying to decide which one, maybe ubuntu? Anyone recommend a particular linux?)\nI would try solving your current problem before introducing another OS in the setup, there are high probabiliites to worsen the whatever problem you are currently experiencing.  \n\n\u003e A friend says that win98 can be emulated on XP, so maybe I dont have to worry about running it straight? But what program compatability and system requirements are there? Wouldn\u0027t it be more demanding to run win98 in emulation on XP then directly?\nSure it is.  \nAs a rule of thumb, a \"real\" emulation (a Virtual Machine) is MUCH slower that \"direct\", with a factor of 3 to 1 against or 2,5 to 1 against.  \nYou can usually run Win9x apps under WINE (under Linux), but games are usually very, very difficult to setup as they mostly use undocumented or direct accesses to the underlying hardware.  \nDOSBOX:  \n[http://www.dosbox.com/](http://www.dosbox.com/ \"External link\")  \nis a good platform for DOS games:  \n[http://www.dosbox.com/comp_list.php](http://www.dosbox.com/comp_list.php \"External link\")?  \n\njaclaz   \n"
