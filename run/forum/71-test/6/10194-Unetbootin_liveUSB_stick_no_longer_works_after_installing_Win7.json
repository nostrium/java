      "content": "So I\u0027ve been running Ubuntu in a VM environment for a while, seeing if I like it. I think it\u0027s something I\u0027d like to have as the primary OS on my netbook, so I downloaded the latest Netbook Remix version (9.10). Problem is, I can\u0027t get the thing to boot from my USB stick.  \n\nBefore we get into any lessons on how to set up a USB stick to be bootable, and how to adjust the BIOS\u0027s boot priority... let me say that I\u0027ve used this exact stick and this exact laptop in the past just fine. When my netbook came home from the store with WinXP on it, I created a Live USB using unetbootin v3.56 and made the stick bootable with a gparted-live ISO. I used this to boot from the stick and partition my drive in half so that I could load the Win7 RC onto the other partition. Everything worked great then. I blew away those partitions and went back to a single partition when I loaded up my full Win7 OS a few weeks ago.  \n\nI\u0027m wondering if it\u0027s possible that Win7 does something special with the bootloader to prevent this stick from being recognized? I know that sounds kinda far fetched, but I have a vague sense of having read this somewhere, but I can\u0027t find anything along those lines now.  \n\nJust to be sure, I went into the BIOS and took out both the CD and the HDD from the boot sequence, so the only thing in there was the \"removable device\". I got a \"please insert an operating system\" type message.  \n\nWhen I started this process, the stick was still in \"LiveUSB\" mode with the gparted OS - however, I didn\u0027t test it to see if it would have booted from it. I just assumed that it would have, since that was the last time I used this USB stick.  \n\nHere\u0027s what I\u0027ve tried so far:  \n+ formatted the stick via the Windows Explorer right-click-format routine.  \n+ re-ran unetbootin with the Remix.ISO (no joy)  \n+ re-formatted, downloaded the latest unetbootin version (v3.77), and tried the Remix.ISO again (still nothing)  \n+ re-formatted, tried using the unetbootin \"on board installer\" for Ubuntu 9.10 (where it goes out and fetches the image instead of using a .ISO). Still no joy.  \n\nAny ideas on where I might be going wrong? Is my idea on the Win7-bootloader-blocking-the-stick idea valid at all? My USB stick /does/ go blinky-blinky a few times when the computer is booting.  \n\nI just ran a test to prove that it wasn\u0027t the USB stick causing problems... I just booted my wife\u0027s desktop from it, and it booted into the LiveUSB environment just fine. The desktop is a new HP system that came loaded with Win7 Home 64bit OEM. So, it\u0027s not purely a Windows 7 thing preventing the booting from sitck.  \n\nI also tested my laptop\u0027s boot priority by using a physical CD, and it booted from CD just fine.  \n\na few more details on the netbook... it is an Asus EeePC 1000HE model with 1G ram. I upgraded from the OEM WinXP to Win7 Home Premium off of a \"Family Pack\" that we bought to upgrade the wife\u0027s and kids\u0027 laptops. Figured since we still had 1 license left, I would upgrade mine as well.  \n\nI\u0027d still like to dual-boot this with Ubuntu as the primary OS, but I need to get the stick working, so if anyone has any great ideas, I\u0027m all ears. I\u0027d just create a LiveCD, but I\u0027ll be damned if I can find any blank CDs just laying around... that\u0027s almost as archaic as a floppy these days. Since I don\u0027t do a lot of playing, I don\u0027t really have a need for blank CDs. :/  \n\nThis laptop /*used to* / boot from the stick back when it had WinXP, but will not boot from the same stick now that I\u0027ve reloaded the laptop with Win7.   \n"

I used the Win7 installer to rearrange the partitions and go back to a single partition during the install process. As far as an \"active partition\", I am assuming that you mean on the usb stick? I did do a DISKPART and ensured that the partition was active on the usb drive.

I used HDhacker, selected \"Physical Drive (MBR)\" with disk0 (only 1 hdd in the netbook), and then clicked \"Read sector from disk\"... at which point there was some gibberish in the window. From there I clicked \"Save sector to file\", which created the dat file that I am uploading now.  \n\nSo now... any ideas? (you can select either yes or no). :\\^) Or, more speficially: how do I fix my MBR so that I can boot from my USB?

(??) So, I ran the unetbootin utility again with the same gparted-live ISO that I started this whole adventure with. Obviously, I\u0027m only guessing here, but I was grasping at straws that maybe this \"loads an MBR\".  \n\nOnce unetbootin did it\u0027s thing, I ran HDHacker again (see attached zip, with the \"x3\" file). Neither of the dumps looked \"good\", but all 3 of them look different from each other, so obviously something is changing. Alas, the stick still does not boot. It also no longer boots my wife\u0027s desktop, which it did previously (with the configuration that is shown in the HDHacker dump up a few posts).  \n\nDo you have any further suggestions for me to try?

      "content": "\u003e I\u0027m running Win7, and a search of \"bootmgr\" turned up about 150 results... however, the only file without an extension was c:\\\\windows\\\\boot\\\\PCAT\\\\bootmgr, so unless you say otherwise, that\u0027s what I\u0027m going with as the loader.\n\nYou miss some basics, maybe:  \n[http://www.multibooters.co.uk/](http://www.multibooters.co.uk/ \"External link\")  \n(just read \"windows 7\" instead of Vista on that site)  \n\nHowever, it\u0027s allright, don\u0027t copy anything to the root, you should get a message like \"BOOTMGR is missing\" or \"NTLDR is missing\", this would be enough to make sure that the booting chain:  \nBIOS-\\\u003eMBR-\\\u003ebootsector-\\\u003eloader  \nis working for the first part, i.e.:  \nBIOS-\\\u003eMBR-\\\u003ebootsector  \n\n\u003e That was one of the first things I tried before coming here. When I disable all other devices and boot from the stick, I get the following:  \n\u003e Reboot and select proper boot device.  \n\u003e or Insert Boot Media in selected Boot device and press a key.  \n\u003e (pressing a key results in a repeat of the message)\nGood, that is coming from the BIOS which is not recognizing the device as bootable.  \n\n\u003e Remember, this same stick worked in this same laptop when it had XP loaded. One I loaded Win7, it stopped booting from the stick.\nRemember, you came here because it stopped working, you have to trust me that THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH WHATEVER OS IS INSTALLED! ![:thumbsup:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/thumbsup.gif)   \n\nCome on, use some logic, if the first device that is accessed is the USB stick how can an OS that is installed on an internal hard disk that is NOT accessed during booting make any difference? :wink:  \n\nThe only four reasons that may cause the current not-booting status can be:  \n\n* a failing stick\n* a failing USB bus of the PC\n* a change in BIOS (either settings or a BIOS update)\n* a modified MBR/bootsector of the stick\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nSince I am an optimist, I presume that the first two are NOT the case. ![:whistling:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/happy22.gif), to test them, you need another PC (your wife\u0027s is OK ![:dubbio:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/dubbio.gif), and another USB stick).  \nDo review attentively BIOS settings, there may be some item seemingly unrelated that causes this behaviour.  \n\n\u003e Nope, just a mini (netbook) with 2 USB ports - no hub in use.\nGood.  \n\nWonko   \n"

Same pc, same stick, worked 1 week ago. Loaded W7, tried it all again, fail. Put stick in wife\u0027s PC, it worked, proving that the stick was still good.  \n\n\u003e Come on, use some logic, if the first device that is accessed is the USB stick how can an OS that is installed on an internal hard disk that is NOT accessed during booting make any difference? ![:ranting2:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/ranting2.gif)\nThat was my original question... is it possible that installing Win7 did something to jack all of this up? I cannot logically see how that would be possible, but it is the only part of the equation that is different.  \n\nThe /only/ thing that I can come up with that might make sense is that unetbootin does not work under Win7... or, possibly, Win7 is preventing me from doing something to this stick that needs to be done. Again, a very far fetched idea, but I can\u0027t get it out of my head that Win7 is the only difference. I don\u0027t have an XP load anymore to try creating my boot stick from.  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nOkay, off to read [http://www.multibooters.co.uk/](http://www.multibooters.co.uk/ \"External link\"). Hopefully, I\u0027ll have some time over the weekend to try playing with this some more. I appreciate your continued help.  \n\n(edited for grammar)   \n"

      "content": "Sorry for the delay in getting back to this - it\u0027s been a VERY LONG week at work. Let\u0027s see if I can pick up where this left off....  \n\n\u003e 1. Make a FreeDos bootable stick using RMPrepUSB v2.0.62 and the FreeDos files that come in the download - use 2PTN and LBA options and FAT16 or FAT32\nI tried this and it still didn\u0027t work in my eeePC.  \n\n\u003e 2. Check it boots on your wifes PC\nYep - boots her PC just fine.  \n\n\u003e 3. Try it on your eeePC - does the light on the USB pen go blinky-blink on startup - Y or N ?\nYes, the lights on the stick blink during boot.  \n\n\u003e 4. Does it try to boot at all? Any message?\nNo messages, it just goes straight into Windows.  \n\n\u003e 5. Try the other USB port on the eeePC\nTried all 3 - same results.  \n\n\u003e Are you sure that you used the same stick to boot successfully before (or maybe a similar one that you had around but not that actual one?).\nIt was this same exact stick.  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n\u003e What size is the stick? Can you try another stick?\nIt\u0027s a 4GB stick. I found an 8GB stick gathering dust in the bottom of one of my drawers... tried that too, with the same results. This 8GB stick also DOES boot my wife\u0027s PC.  \n\nI reformatted both USB sticks, and loaded a couple of different ISO images using unetbootin (I tried doing this from both the PC and the netbook - results did not vary, no matter the combination of computer+stick). In all cases, the PC booted from both sticks, the netbook did not.  \n\nAttached is a photograph of the netbook boot screen, if this helps with interpreting anything. Notice the line \"USB Device(s):\" That\u0027s what it looks like with the stick plugged in. If I unplug the stick, that line is blank. If I plug in my external CD, that line indicates \"ASUS USB CD/DVD\". If I plug in a Keyboard, that line indicates \"USB Keyboard\". If I plug in all 3 (stick, cd, kb), all 3 devices are listed.  \n\nNow note the last line: \"Device #01\" looks like it is not finding the device. If I have the stick in, this screen pauses for about 5 seconds (allowing me to take a picture) before going blank and loading windows. If I take the stick out, then this screen flashes by too fast for me to even see any of it. If I have a bootable LiveCD in the external CD drive, this screen still flashes by too quick to see, but the eeePC will boot into the LiveCD just fine.  \n\nMaybe some of that means something. ??  \n\nAlso: I tried to change 1 setting in the BIOS. Under the \"Boot\" menu, there is a \"Boot Settings Configuration\" option. Under that, there are 2 settings: \"Quick Boot\" and \"Quiet Boot\". Both of these were set to \"Enable\", so I changed them to \"Disable\". That did not change anything, although I was able to see the bios screen (in photo) whereas I never saw that previously. (fwiw, these were both set to \"enable\" when the netbook used to boot successfully from USB stick).  \n\n#### Attached Thumbnails {#attach_wrap}\n\n* [![biosphoto.jpg](http://reboot.pro/uploads/monthly_01_2010/post-32134-1264963551_thumb.jpg)](http://reboot.pro/uploads/monthly_01_2010/post-32134-1264963551.jpg \"biosphoto.jpg - Size: 156.42KB\"){#ipb-attach-url-10393-0-53091600-1676066674}\n\n"
