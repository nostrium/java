      "content": "Hello,  \nI make a bootable usb pen for winpe3. It works fine on many differents computers. But not on nec VL 280 (not so old). Some computers (hp 6005, a new one) doens\u0027t boot on USB pen even Setup Bios is ok (or seems ok). The V280 see the usb pen but mbr display \"no system\" (or like this, message is at office, tomorrow i\u0027ll see who display it).  \nSome bios speak about usb_zip or usb_hdd.   \n\nMy questions :  \nIs exist a \"good tutorial\" which explain the \"art\" of inter-action BIOS / boot USB?  \n\nAnd what are diff√©rences between a usb pen of 16go and an extern disk usb (ide) of 80go when they are NTFS?  \nI think they have the same logical structure. Perhaps some thing change in the usb part. I compare with usbview.exe of DDK (W2K3) but i don\u0027t see any difference. And one or more differences exist really...for vl280 for sample.  \n\nBut boot usb has many \"mysteres\".   \nThanks  \n\nPS : I know that 80h is the number for int13h that identify the first disk, and 80h is required for an active partition, data and code of MBR/BR, boot NTFS, bootmgr, BCD, bootsect, diskpart, i display MBR/BR with diskprobe of ResourceKit of NT4 (i began with dos 3 and debug to explore hd)...   \n\nAnd i write like a french man. So, don\u0027t be worry and scratch this post if it\u0027s too difficult to understand me.   \n"

      "content": "hello,  \nan other time, sorry for my poor english.  \n\nI trie about 30 PC (notebook, desktop), 5 years old and newest, a dozen of USB stick, a dozen of external disk UsB.  \n\nExternal Disk USB always boot in these PC, only a few of stick boot. Some PB boots with sticks less 4Go but don\u0027t boot with the stick usb of 16Go.  \n\nWith plob on a stick usb, stick UsB boot very quickly (it\u0027s very good when Pc don\u0027t propose parameters for different vitesses : V1, V2 higth, V2 full). But not work for all of these PC. Plob on CD works fine but \"not very friendly\".  \n\nIt\u0027s the \"jungle\".  \n\nIs USB V3 make something to normalize boot stick USB?  \n\nalso an other question, but perhaps i must cut in two posts....  \n\nI read in a forum that stick usb use SCSI commands. And during format time, it\u0027s possible to reserve some space \"unwritable\". I found that when i was looking for a stick i can\u0027t format (XP says \"write protected\"). I used the program ( on a pc without hard disk because i was afraid by virus) :  \n[http://www.apacer.co...ir_v2.9.1.1.zip](http://www.apacer.com/en/support/downloads/Repair_v2.9.1.1.zip \"External link\")  \nThe link is ok to day but virus or not, i don\u0027t kown.  \nIt works for me and after that i can format the stick under xp.  \n\nSo, my question : is it possible to use this special space (write protected), mask and unmask data without a \"proprietary\" mecanisme of encryption protection (which use, i think, a driver loaded in the Os) ?  \nCould someone explain me more than these scsi command, these reserved space, and eventually how to use it?  \n\nThank.  \n\nPs : if my english is too difficult to understand, don\u0027t be worry and forget me.   \n"

Thank for this program.  \n\nWell, i look in the \"hard\", in the network usb, in the commands on the frame usb, the scsi commands used to read/write/format the stick. Not the ones used by the API win32. But theses whitch are \"under the hood\".  \n\nThe source of my informations :  \n\n- about the technique of \"lockable storage\"  \n[http://www.usb.org/d...s_Agreement.zip](http://www.usb.org/developers/devclass_docs/Lockable_Mass_Storage_Spec_and_Adopters_Agreement.zip \"External link\")  \n...Today there is no standard infrastructure in USB to control access to USB storage devices.  \nLoss and theft of these devices concerns both consumers and corporations. Consumers want to avoid accidentally sharing personal information. Corporations want to avoid accidentally sharing trade secrets and other confidential data.  \nThis feature specification extends the USB Mass Storage class to allow hosts and devices to lock and unlock storage, without breaking legacy software behavior that exists today and without resorting to vendor-specific descriptors and requests....  \n\n- about scsi above usb (on the network usb)  \n[http://www.usb.org/d...cs/uasp_1_0.zip](http://www.usb.org/developers/devclass_docs/uasp_1_0.zip \"External link\")  \n....UASP (USB Attached SCSI Protocol) will improve efficiency in \\[USB2\\]....  \n\n- for the commande \"format\" and the \"defect list\" :   \n[http://www.usb.org/d...bmass-ufi10.pdf](http://www.usb.org/developers/devclass_docs/usbmass-ufi10.pdf \"External link\")  \nit speaks about the command \"format\". It also introduce differents layers, the UFI... I think the floppy implementation is \"conceptually\" identical as hard disk implemenation in the hardware stick.  \n\nToo many texts en english for me.  \n\nThe \"defect list\" technique can\u0027t show/hide datas in stick because i think it\u0027s need format and so erase datas.  \nThe \"lockable storage\" technique is built for \"that\" but i don\u0027t know to use it.  \n\nMy question is perhaps too generic : how to use this \"lockable storage\" technique?  \n\nPs : many differences between API scsi (library depreciated?) but scsi commands send in the embeded frame on the network usb. And API windows like createfile or formatEx mask the real layers of protocols, like smb, socket or namedpipe.  \n\nPerhaps formatting with the win32api formatEx is not really the same thing that formatting with building a frame to put on the usb network.  \n\nPerhaps one day, it comes a filter driver whitch display the different layers on the network usb, like whireshark can do for ethernet.   \n"

      "content": "Forget the SCSI layer: it is NOT implemented in current sticks, and however has NOTHING to do with the problem you are having, believe me.   \n\nMost USB sticks - please read as ALL of them - are set (actually the controller in them) as \"Removable\".  \nMost USB HD\u0027s and the HD cases you can find - please read as ALL of them - are set (actually the controller in them) as \"Fixed\".   \n\nThe \"by design\" behaviour of windows on a device that is set as \"Removable\" is that ONLY one (the active Partition) is accessible/given a drive letter.  \n\nThe \"by design\" behaviour of various BIOSes is UNKNOWN, every manufacturer uses his own ways, it is perfectly possible that:  \n\n* a size limit is forced in the BIOS for \"Removable\"\n* a partition ID (say 06, FAT16 CHS) is needed by BIOS\n* ...\n* ...\n\n(please do review the links I already gave you)  \n\nThere has been reports of some BIOS that \"like\" having 2 partitions on the \"Removable\" stick in order to boot from one, hence the 2 PTNS in RMPREPUSB.  \n\nThere has NEVER been reports of a stick that has been \"forced\", by \"flipping the bit\" to become \"Fixed\" failing to boot, just like there has NEVER been a report of an external USB HD (which is already by default \"Fixed\") that failed to boot - of course provided that the motherboard BIOS accepts \"USB HD\" as bootable device.  \n\nThe solution for sticks is then to \"flip the bit\".  \nTo do so you need the \"Manufacturer Tool\" (and nothing else, and nothing else will work).  \n\nNow to your questions:  \n\u003e Q1 : is it a way to identify why the usb 16G dosen\u0027t boot on this PC?\nThere is NO sense in identifying why that particular stick does not boot on that PC, the reason is because the particular BIOS of that PC \"wants\" something in order to boot a USB stick (see any item of the lists already given), so the why is already clear: non-standard PC BIOS, the problem is identifying which particular requirements the BIOS is looking for, but the problem is making it boot.  \nIf this is the question, there are only TWO possible solutions:  \n\n* try partitioning/formatting it with one of the ways that have been reported to be more compatible\n* find the \"Manufacturer Tool\" for the specific stick and \"flip the bit\"\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nOn a probability scale, using another partitioning/formatting scheme has definitely more than 50% probabilities of being successful, let\u0027s say 70√∑80%, while flipping the bit is very, very near to 100%.  \n\n\u003e Q2 : is an information coming from the layer \"scsi\" that identify fixe/removable or coming from MBR/BR? If you think \"Yes\", can i modify it to test the result?\nWe don\u0027t think ![:exclamation:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/exclamation.gif) , we KNOW there is NO way if not through the \"Manufacturer\u0027s Tool\", as each single chip maker has his own particular way to change the Firmware of the device, which is where the \"Removable\" bit is, I repeat there is NO standard layer/language/protocol/whatever to communicate with the proprietary device if not the particular language/code the manufcturer of the chip has implemented.  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nAnd now, allow me one of my grumpy comments ![:exclamation:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/exclamation.gif) :  \n\nI don\u0027t understand WHY you come here, ask advice about a problem, you are told to try using RMPREPUSB, and then you come back to whine about the fact that NOT using it your stick won\u0027t boot. ![:D](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/biggrin.png)  \n\nA quick review of the \"common sense advice\" attached to Rules (point #f) may be of interest to you:  \n[http://www.boot-land...?showtopic\u003d9101](http://www.boot-land.net/forums/index.php?showtopic\u003d9101 \"External link\")  \n![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif)   \nGoogle translate gives a good enough translation:  \n[http://translate.goo...t...l\u003d\\\u0026ie\u003dUTF-8](http://translate.google.it/translate?u\u003dhttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.boot-land.net%2Fforums%2Findex.php%3Fshowtopic%3D9101\u0026sl\u003den\u0026tl\u003dfr\u0026hl\u003d\u0026ie\u003dUTF-8 \"External link\")  \n\nSo, and again my contribution in this thread is only aimed at trying to help you with the problem you are having :smile:, and not necessarily connected to the \"philosophy\" of layer/protocols and whatever ![:(](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/sad.png), you are advised to:  \n\n* EASY -\\\u003e try using RMPREPUSB or any other tool that allows for a \"more compatible\" partitioning/formatting scheme, you will need to experiment with different settings.\n* DIFFICULT -\\\u003e Get Chipgenius: [http://www.boot-land...?showtopic\u003d4661](http://www.boot-land.net/forums/index.php?showtopic\u003d4661 \"External link\")  \n* identify the chip used in that particular USB stick\n* find the corresponding \"Manufacturer Tool\" (if available) - if you cannot find the tool post the info Chipgenius gives and I\u0027ll try and help you finding it. :smile:\n* flip the \"Removable\" bit to \"Fixed\"\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nNow up to you if you want to risk trusting my advice and possibly have that d@mn thing booting :wink: or if you prefer to go on with theories and hypothesys.  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n![:exclamation:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/exclamation.gif)  \n\nWonko   \n"
