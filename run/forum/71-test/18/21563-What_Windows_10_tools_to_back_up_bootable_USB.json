The main advantage is that it does not have to copy everything, just what\u0027s changed. I happen to use Syncback Pro.\n\nI create a folder on my HDD and sync the entire stick to it. I do this weekly because I\u0027ve corrupted the stick too many times and it takes too long to recreate the stuff. I use it as a backup of many important docs and databases, I also have tons of fairly static stuff - boot ISOs and installation files. The weekly backup assures me I can get it back just about like it was quickly..\n\n"
