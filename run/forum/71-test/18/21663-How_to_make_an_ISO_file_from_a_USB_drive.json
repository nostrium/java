(or however does your current USB stick boot as BIOS or as UEFI)?\n\nMore or less - loosely - a \"recovery\" is made of:\n\n1) some booting files (either BOOTMGR or BOOTMGR.EFI + their BCD(s) and possibly a number of language files)\n\n2) a (largish) .wim file, called often boot.wim or recovery.wim\n\nin other words, it is - generally - a WinPE of some kind.\n\nSo in a multiboot USB stick, it is not usually added as .ISO (but there still may be reasons why this is \\*needed\\*), but rather added, directly or indirectly, to the bootmanager used as a .wim file.\n\n![:duff:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/duff.gif)\n\nWonko\n\n"

It\u0027s not exactly obvious, at first look it seems ImgBurn can only work with discs, but as this tutorial shows one can actually use it to create an ISO file from a USB drive, just what I needed.\n\nNow I\u0027m using YUMI Multiboot to add it to my multiboot USB drive. It\u0027s still writing, once done I\u0027ll put it to the test and hope it\u0027ll work.\n\nThanks for your help guys :smile:\n\n"

Either that, or I could just leave it alone where it is in it\u0027s own USB key. Lets not forget that I am only doing this just so I could have it along with other ISOs in the same USB key, for CONVENIENCE. But if the process entails to go beyond practical and efficient then we go into wasting time issues. And time is not something I have a lot of.\n\n"
