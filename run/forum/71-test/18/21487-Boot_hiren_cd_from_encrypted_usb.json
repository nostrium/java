      "content": "Hello, im trying to boot hirens boot cd from a truecrypt encrypted drive. The hirens cd is installed in the hidden truecrypt volume.  \nI wanna boot the live usb (hidden partition). The two ways i know may work are:  \n1) Create a rescue disc and boot with it. But the software doesn\u0027t create one for encrypted usb. So ill have to copy truecrypt files into non hidden volume and run it in boot time and access the encrypted volume.  \n\n2) Directly run truecrypt in dos mode (commandline) by installing dos on unhidden volume and access the hidden volume to boot from. But how do i do it?   \n\n**Edited by coc9, 07 April 2017 - 06:20 PM.**\n"
