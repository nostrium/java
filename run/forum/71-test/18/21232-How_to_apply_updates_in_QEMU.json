      "content": "Wonko,\n\nWell. I\u0027ll tell you the full story (and I beg your pardon for its length).  \nMy final target was to check \\\u0026 test the QEMU/VirtualBox-VMUB (Virtual Machine USB Boot, the DavidB\u0027s tool).  \nIt\u0027s worth saying here that the direct trials with the VirtualBox-VMUB combo went fine, just at first shot.  \nInstead, for the QEMU-VMUB case, before going directly with the combo trials, as an intermediate step I preferred to check (separately and independently) the QEMU Manager functionalities, since I\u0027d never used that tool.  \nUnfortunately (but only later I realized this was my innocent fault), the bootable UFD I used for the first trials was based on a WinPE for Windows 10 (64 bit) and so in no way I was able to boot that UFD.  \nIt was at this point that, having the feeling that the installed Qemu Manager was using a very old qemu.exe version (therefore, not compatible with the \"advanced\" WinPE), I decided to look for some updated executables and so I installed the last version of Qemu for Windows tool (from Stefan Weil Page).  \nBut, after several tests (with negative results) it was clear that I should have asked for some help to the Reboot experts, opening this thread.  \nThen, once I read your post, before proceding with your advices, I realized the idea about the \"too much advanced WinPE\" and therefore I built another bootable UFD (but based on a more \"standard\" WinPE 3.1). This time, QEMU Manager was able to boot the new UFD, even if very, very slowly...  \nFinally, hoping to improve/extend the capabilities of QEMU (in order to boot more advanced WinPEs), I followed your advices making the last tests and trying to extend/translate the commands from Qemu Manager to Qemu for Windows, but this is a well known story...(described in Post #3).  \nTherefore, to make the long story short, I\u0027d say that the main problem I had with the old qemu.exe (coming with Qemu Manager) seems to stay on its \"limited\" compatibility with \"newer\" WinPEs/OS.  \nRegarding the version of qemu, I was not able to determine it for the Qemu manager I have tested. What I can say is that the Qemu Manager version is the last official one (7.0) and the properties of qemu.exe are :  \nDimensions : 2.010.112 bytes  \nDate 28/3/2010  \nSHA-1: 5D07EABA89B2FD19E6EC7F86ED4DA21B5BCDF7E9  \nTherefore, if you think yours is newer, please send it to me, possibly together with some companion notes/documentation.  \nambralivio\n\n"
