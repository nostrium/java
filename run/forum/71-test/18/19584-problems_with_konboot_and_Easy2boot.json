That was all fixed with settings in my bios with IDE, legacy and even took out boot from CD/DVD and USB to boot first. I just hit F10 on my intel MOBO and now all my Hiren\u0027s utils work, DOS, etc.\n\nI went through Steve\u0027s tutorial on the RMPrepUSB site to a tee, but kon-boot won\u0027t work.\n\nWhat I get after the menu selection is just a black screen that is stuck. I do see the first couple of commands go by, then I\u0027m dead in the water. I originally thought this was due to the USB not seeing all my HDD sata drives, but now I have the other tools seeing them just fine, like the partition tools in the DOS utils.\n\nMy drive where my Windows 7 install is Loc 0(Chan 0, Target 0, Lun 0), Steve, wondering based on that if I need to modify your example menu list file for that???\n\nI\u0027ve tried with kon-boot USB img and the Kon Floppy img, but no luck. I also tried the example in your tutorial included from this site, but no luck either.\n\nCan someone please help me? not that I really have to have that tool working, but it\u0027s driving me crazy and now I have to make it work.\n\nThanks!\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks Steve for getting back so quickly.\n\nI\"m not sure if my Win 7 in UEFI or not, I don\u0027t think it is. It\u0027s Windows 7 Ultimate, my motherboard is an Intel motherboard D845WN, about 5-6 years old.\n\nI did not have a setupact.log file in the c:\\\\windows\\\\panther dir, so could not confirm UEFI.\n\nI have 4 hard drives in the system, all sata. 750g, and 3 1tb drives\n\nMy windows 7 boots from the 750g.\n\nMy DVD is also sata.\n\nThere are no IDE drives or cables hooked up.\n\nI\u0027m hoping my kon-bootfloppy file is okay. Is there a generice test img that you know works I can download to verify that is not my problem? But my guess is the one on the Hiren\u0027s disk should be good enough.\n\nI also have the Hirens DLC ISO and that kon-boot is not working either.\n\noh, btw.......I just double checked your kon 2.1 menu and it did not work for me.\n\nDisk Management does not report EFI System for any of the drives.\n\nSorry for the multiple edits, after running MSinfo32, my board is a DQ965GF and I do not see a BIOS mode of UEFI.\n\n**Edited by camelx, 25 February 2014 - 12:22 AM.**\n"

      "content": "I realize this thread is more than a year old, but I\u0027ll post anyway, in case someone else comes across it after googling for \"kon-boot black screen\" (as I did).\n\nI am using kon-boot 2.4, but I have run across this problem with prior versions as well. On most systems it starts fine, but occasionally I\u0027ve tried it on one where I just get a black screen from it, without any splash screen. The problem, as best I can tell, arises from a routine that it\u0027s using to start drawing the splash screen. The program enters a conditional loop, but the condition is never met, so it ends up in an infinite loop. (Thank you Quaid Analyzer for helping me find this!)\n\nFor version 2.4 a way to solve it is to patch the image file before burning it. Using a hex editor, search the image file for the hex string:\n\n8A E0 3C 10 75 DC\n\nIt should occur only once in the file. When you find it, change the 75 to EB. Save the file, and then commit it to the medium of your choice. When you run kon-boot, the colors on the splash screen will be wonky, but hopefully you should avoid at least this cause of a black screen.\n\n**Edited by vance003, 03 April 2015 - 02:47 PM.**\n"
