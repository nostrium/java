If the bad-OS-x powerful, it is thanks to GRUB2, I just show the magic above GRUB2 just bad-OS-x engine is free open source software, in full compliance with GNU-related agreements.  \n\u003e\n\u003e Resources include: source code, DEMO package, help documentation, if you need video presentations, go to China that download point.  \n\u003e\n\u003e Sorry!

Even the most talented Chinese developers don\u0027t even know the basics of English. \u0027PECMD\u0027 is another example peace of software. It has English documentation which is based on Google translate. If you ever hit a Chinese website as part of a google search result, you have to rely on Google translate again as 99% of Chinese websites don\u0027t have any English content. As far as i know, English is not taught at schools in China - even as a second language. I didn\u0027t mean any disrespect to the OP.\n\n"
