He also has an an HDD in a optical caddy which cannot be made to boot first even by explicit selection, he has to physically swap it into the primary SATA port first.

He also has an an HDD in a optical caddy which cannot be made to boot first even by explicit selection, he has to physically swap it into the primary SATA port first.
