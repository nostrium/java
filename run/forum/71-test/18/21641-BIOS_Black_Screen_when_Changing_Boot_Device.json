      "content": "Hello,\n\nI\u0027m dealing with a weird issue and I really need some help. I have two SSD drives connected to an ASUS MAXIMUS RANGER VII motherboard. In one SSD I\u0027m using Windows 8.1 Pro x64, on the other SSD I have openSuse x64.\n\nI don\u0027t have dual-boot enabled so when I want to swicth between them I just use the boot menu and select which drive to boot.\n\nThe problem is that whenever I try to boot Linux (after using Windows) I get a black screen. No BIOS POST, no boot selection, nothing. DEL key or F8 key does nothing.\n\nI get POST only when I disconnect both SSDs and do a reboot. Only then I can boot to Linux. I only get the back screen when trying to switch from one device to the other.\n\nWhat I\u0027ve tried so far:\n\n* switched monitor from dedicated graphics card output to onboard card output\n* disconnected all usb devices from motherboard\n* enabled/disabled onboard graphics card\n* switch SSDs to different SATA ports\n\nThe BIOS has enabled CSM with Secure Boot. And I\u0027m using the latest BIOS version.\n\nThank you!\n\n"

I only have the option of clearing the 4 keys for secure boot. I\u0027m not sure if by clearing these my problem will be fixed\n* Windows was installed and Linux were installed in CSM mode.\n* On my BIOS boot menu I have both options for legacy and uefi boot, while linux also has secure boot (ie opensuse, opensuse-secureboot, and UEFI opensuse)\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n"
