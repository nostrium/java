To put a long story short, I have a laptop with dead HDD and I want to try it running from my usb flash drive.  \nI have read in this forum that it is possible to install Windows XP on USB flash drive, and I have searched all over Google, but every solution is terribly hard or takes a long time to put it to work.  \nSo I wanted to ask, what is the easiest way to install Win XP on USB Flash?  \n\nMy USB flash is 16GB, USB 2.0, and laptop has 512mb ram.  \nThanks in advance.   \n"

      "content": "Geez, you guys really dug up an old thread.\n\nmeniyakalpeshjeetubhai - NO, if you manage to install Windows to a flash drive it will NOT delete the contents of the HDD. At least no way that I\u0027ve done it.\n\nWonko the Insane - yes, it\u0027s glacially slow. I regularly use an app named [Win To USB](http://www.easyuefi.com/wintousb/ \"External link\") and back up my laptop\u0027s SSD to a USB HDD, a WD Passport drive to be precise. And even on a USB HDD on a USB 3 port it is so slow I\u0027d hate to use it regularly. I just do it for the hell of it and should my SSD bite the dust I would be ready to go with something to limp along with from a spare USB HDD. As long as you use it only on the unit on which it was created on it will not prompt toe reactivate Windows. If you try it on another computer it will trigger the reactivation and if done too many times will lock out the activation code.\n\nAs an emergency boot media I have my own flavor of Windows PE made with WinBuilder in various flavors (7 and 10 in 32 and 64 bit). I use these along with Easy2boot to start up PCs with mucked up HDDs in order to back up data. I also use it to image and restore systems as well.\n\n"
