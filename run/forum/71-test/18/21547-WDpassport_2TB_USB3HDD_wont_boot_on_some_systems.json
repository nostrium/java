      "content": "hi all  \n\nI have a WD passport 0820 2TB (\\~1875GB useable) USB3.0 HDD   \n\nit has three primary partitions and one extended with six logical partitions.  \n\nP1 is Fat32 and the rest are NTFS  \n\nI can boot multiple (countless) OS from this on most systems but today I found a second system that does not even recognize it as a bootable USB.  \n\nboth systems that do not recognize it for booting were toshiba laptops (years apart) but they both recognize all other USB HDDs I have tried.  \n\nwhen i first got this WD USB3.0 HDD, the first thing I noticed was that it prompted windows needing a driver (WD SES Device)   \n\nit came with the drivers but i never install them and it always works without them. im not sure if that has anything to do with the booting problem though. i just thought it was odd that it needed drivers and this is my largest USB HDD.  \n\nboth the laptops that wont boot from it are older one with usb2.0  \n\nhas anyone else run across USB HDDs that do not show up as bootable? both systems that wont boot it, see it fine when its plugged into them while they are running.  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nthanks   \n"

If you use a Y-cable then you can use two USB ports and thus get twice the power.\n\nIf you have an IODD, they will show the USB voltage. Check if it is 5V.\n\nif you have a powered USB hub - plug it into that.\n\n"

      "content": "I thought we were following alacran\u0027s suggestion.\n\nThe \"USB voltmeter\" Zoso has should be a small box with a USB A male (to be inserted in the USB A port of the computer) and a USB A female (in which you insert a SUB A male device), something roughly like:\n\n[https://images-na.ss...L70_FMwebp_.jpg](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41%2BMVSlgnpL._SX300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg \"External link\")\n\nIf the issue is the USB A connector (either the port on the PC or the male connector on the WD hard disk cable) making poor contact then inserting in the middle a (good) USB A extension cable may do something, but if the issue is not connected with a bad contact, it won\u0027t do anything (and as well the USB A male to Micro-B USB 2.0 cable).\n\nI.e. if (for whatever \"side effect\") it is the voltmeter that triggers \\*something\\* it cannot be replaced by a passive cable.\n\nAnd if the issue (again for whatever reasons) is on the Micro USB 3.0 side of the WD cable (or in the WD enclosure port) the voltmeter should not be changing anything at all.\n\nI now understand that the alternative theory is that something in the USB 3.0 cable may be different from a similar USB 2.0 cable.\n\nSo the idea is to use INSTEAD of a USB 3.0 A to Micro-B Superspeed cable, a USB 2.0 A to Micro-B cable, plugging it in the \"left side\" of the USB 3.0 Superspeed receptacle on the hard disk.\n\nI would still try a Y cable, like these:\n\nUSB 2.0:\n\n[https://www.startech...ro-B\\~USB2HAUBY1](https://www.startech.com/Cables/USB-2.0/Micro/1foot-USB-Y-Cable-for-External-Hard-Drive-Dual-USB-A-to-Micro-B~USB2HAUBY1 \"External link\")\n\nUSB 3.0:\n\n[https://oyendigital....-3-Y-CABLE.html](https://oyendigital.com/hard-drives/store/USB-3-Y-CABLE.html \"External link\")\n\nOr \"generic\" like this:\n\n[https://www.aliexpre...0208.4.1.aCBta3](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/2-Port-USB-2-0-Data-Power-A-Male-to-Female-Splitter-Y-Cable-Cord-15cm/32267063959.html?spm\u003d2114.40010208.4.1.aCBta3 \"External link\")\n\nThe one Zoso already has is likely a Y cable with two A Males to one Mini B:\n\n[https://www.startech...ni-B\\~USB2HABMY3](https://www.startech.com/Cables/USB-2.0/Mini/3-ft-USB-Y-Cable-for-External-Hard-Drive-USB-A-to-mini-B~USB2HABMY3 \"External link\")\n\nor the older kind with two USB A and a B male:\n\n[http://www.stuartcon...le-E174089.html](http://www.stuartconnections.com/en/other/6380-Longwell-40-inch-Type-B-to-2x-Type-A-USB-20-Y-Cable-E174089.html \"External link\")\n\nSo, a converter \\*like\\*:  \n[http://www.ebay.com/...er/272331182827](http://www.ebay.com/itm/USB-2-0-Micro-B-Male-to-Mini-B-Female-5-Pins-Charger-Adapter-Connector-Converter/272331182827 \"External link\")\n\n[http://www.l-com.com...andard-b-female](http://www.l-com.com/usb-usb-adapter-micro-b-male-standard-b-female \"External link\")\n\nwould be needed.\n\nAm I getting it right now? ![:unsure:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/unsure.png)\n\n![:duff:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/duff.gif)\n\nWonko\n\n"

      "content": "In order to measure voltage.  \nYou must place a load across it, and then take your measurements.  \n\"Advanced measurement techniques are not considered here\".  \nEither measuring current or voltage drops or voltage directly will work.  \nAlbeit, the load will be extremely small, from 1Meg on down.  \nYour voltmeter is most likely digital, what\u0027d you pay for the voltmeter, $5-$10.???  \nJust remember, the usb 5V also has to drive the lcd display, and the measuring chip, so now the load just went up.  \nI haven\u0027t checked any specs, but your probably in the low mili-amp range. say 5-10 Ma  \nWhat always helps is to clean and maintain.  \nFirst, clean the USB male connectors with a white eraser, you will see them shine right up.  \nit only takes a couple of light swipes, making sure to clear all rubber dust when done.  \nCleaning Female connectors are more difficult.  \nTo clean them I will take a thinly sliced white eraser, and move it in and out to clean contacts.  \nOr a new toothbrush.  \nIf you inspect your cleaning under magnification, you will see what is shiny and what isn\u0027t.  \nSliding your connectors in and out of a USB connections a few times will also reveal vital clues.  \nAnother thing to consider is the springiness or tension of the female connector.  \nDisclaimer: \"The following advice is Not for Rookies\".  \nIf you find that the contacts have become weak and have lost their spring.  \nI will take a paperclip, put a very small, say 1/16th\" 90 degree bend on the tip,  \nsometimes it helps to clean up the tip of the clip first, with sandpaper or such to resemble a dental probe.  \nAnd remove any burs that may damage your contacts.  \nWhat you are attempting, is to slide the bent part of the clip, underneath the  \nSpringy contact, and then twist the clip, to bend the contacts up, \u0027do not twist too hard\u0027,  \nor you will pop the contacts right out, also, try not to place your bends all in one place.  \nI find it best to place 3 bends at 1/3r, middle, 1/3rd.  \nWhile bending, use a toothpick to hold down other parts of the contact to get good bends.  \nOf course, all of the above should NOT be attempted with power applied.  \nThis is usually a last ditch effort, because if you muck it up, your F\u0027d.  \nFYI. outside 2 connectors of USB\u003d 5v, inside 2 connectors of USB\u003d Data.  \nRegards  \nRoyM\n\n"
