      "content": "In your case, the correct phrasing would be to boot from, not into, your laptop\u0027s card reader.\n\nWith that said, very few notebooks have the ability to boot via an internal SD. Booting an SD reader plugged in via USB is usually no issue, since the BIOS will see it as a USB device.\n\nUnless you can find some way to chainload your internal SD, this probably will never work. Even then GRUB2 will need some kind of driver/firmware/module/etc so that it can see the SD reader at all.\n\n"
