I need DOS 6.22 in order to run some legacy programs on very expensive hardware that I can\u0027t run the risk of trying another version of DOS or FreeDOS on.\n\nDOS 6.22 and the Windows 7 installers boot well enough, but the problem I\u0027m now having is that I have no way of supplying the legacy programs I need to run to DOS 6.22 once its been booted from the USB. Copying these programs to the root of the USB doesn\u0027t seem to work; as soon as DOS is booted, all it sees are the 40 files that it comes packaged with.\n\n**Where in the bootable USB do I put my programs so that MS-DOS 6.22 can access it?** If there is no such place, is there any other way to easily give DOS access to those programs?\n\nThanks in advance, I\u0027d really appreciate some help on this.\n\n**Edited by Kaos-Industries, 15 July 2017 - 11:43 PM.**\n"

Does the USB need to formatted as FAT16 just to see the legacy program files on the USB? I always assumed that if it runs on the USB that it should also be read files from it?\n\nI tried E2B when initially trying to set this up, but I\u0027m not fond of the E2B boot menu and found that it added way too many nested menus and menu items for me that would take a while to customise to my heart\u0027s content. This is why I currently prefer using WinSetupFromUSB, which boots by default into grub4DOS resulting in a simple but good-looking boot menu from the outset.\n\nAs for the final method, at this point that definitely seems like the more attractive, easiest option. I tried doing it today - I extracted all the files from the original DOS 6.22 ISO, and used ImgBurn to write those files as well as the legacy executables into a new ISO. I even experimented with making it bootable from within ImgBurn, using the original ISO as the boot file, but still couldn\u0027t get it working. Is there a specific process involved in creating a bootable DOS image from files? Am I missing something?\n\n\u003e MS-DOS 6.22, that is.\n\u003e\n\u003e MS-DOS 7.0 onwards can access FAT32.\n\u003e\n\u003e @Kaos-Industries\n\u003e\n\u003e If you have to run a specific version of MS-DOS to run legacy programs on very expensive hardware, then surely you can afford to have a DEDICATED DOS ONLY USB stick.\n\u003e\n\u003e Mind you there is no known reason to assume that the multibooting may EVER lead to any kind of \"corruption\" of the environment, but if you cannot risk to test the software with a newer DOS version, then you shouldn\u0027t risk (even if it is a little/tiny risk) that.\n\u003e\n\u003e Try making a plain, partitioned, FAT16, non-multiboot USB stick with MS-DOS 6.22 and your software (and nothing else).\n\u003e\n\u003e How exactly to do that is another thing, what I would personally ddo would be to make a \"normal\" install of the DOS into a VM (actually a specific one, the QEMU) on an image of suitable size and then dd the image to the USB stick.\n\u003e\n\u003e You should make the RAW image larger than around 512 Mb (but not larger than 2 Gb) to make sure that both the BIOS of the VM and the real hardware detect the geometry as 255/63.\n\u003e\n\u003e See here:  \n\u003e [http://reboot.pro/to...isk-boot-image/](http://reboot.pro/topic/15839-pengos-guide-to-making-a-dos-hard-disk-boot-image/ \"\")\n\u003e\n\u003e For a complete set of instructions (they are about FreeDOS and/or Windows 98, i.e. DOS 7.1, but you can use the same with DOS and particularly DOS 6.22 as long as you use FAT16 and a disk size in the given range).\n\u003e\n\u003e Having the DOS on a .iso is not usually a good idea (because the .iso is read only) and surely your software needs to save some info somewhere.\n\u003e\n\u003e It is possible to use a ramdisk (but then the whole stuff would be \"volatile\" ) or mount another volume (with a RW filesystem that MSDOS 6.22 can understand, which must then be ether FAT12 or FAT16) but it would be more complex and possibly (it really depends on the software) it may not work as that would be another (non-C:\\\\ ) drive letter (there are possible workarounds/solutions to this issue, but they represent a further complication).\n\u003e\n\u003e ![:duff:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/duff.gif)\n\u003e\n\u003e Wonko\n\nI extend the same question to you - what\u0027s meant by FAT32 support? My USB is FAT32, and I always assumed that if I get to the point where DOS 6.22 boots successfully from it, then compatibility isn\u0027t the issue. Is this not the case?\n\nAs I said on the other thread, I don\u0027t think the multibooting will be a problem, as unlike with the DOS version, there\u0027s nothing to really suggest that multibooting will introduce any new problems.\n\nRegarding the read-only thing, I looked into it today, and from what I can tell, those in the industry tend to also run the legacy programs using ISOs from bootable USBs, so it doesn\u0027t look like that issue will introduce any problem. All the program is doing is writing or removing a few characters from the memory addresses of a vehicle, so it doesn\u0027t seem like it would be particularly memory intensive, even for DOS.\n\n\u003e [http://www.rmprepusb...torials/freedos](http://www.rmprepusb.com/tutorials/freedos \"External link\") This may also help as it contains info on making a DOS 6.22 USB drive.\n\u003e\n\u003e Note that once you have a working USB DOS 6.22 flash drive, you can use RMPrepUSB to make an image of the drive and add it to an E2B USB drive as a .imghd file. You can also use various utilities to edit the .img file and add/delete files at any later time.\n\nThis wouldn\u0027t work because RMPrep only allows for the creation of a single-boot USB, and I\u0027m trying to create a multiboot USB. As explained above, I\u0027d rather stick to WinSetup cause it uses grub4DOS, which I prefer the UI and simplicity of, and unlike E2B, it doesn\u0027t have a whole host of default sub-menu items to clean up before I\u0027m comfortable using it.\n\n-------------\n\nOkay, I\u0027ve decided to take the plunge and try out FreeDOS, in the hope that it\u0027ll give me access to executables via the root of the bootable USB.\n\nHow would I install a bootable version of it with WinSetupFromUSB? Does it have anything to do with the \"floppy.img\" it comes with? That particular file can\u0027t be used with Winsetup because it only supports ISOs.\n\nThanks to you both for all the help so far.\n\n"

Unfortunately, it seems the method outlined in the tutorial puts the FreeDOS/.IOSYS on the MBR, loading it before grub4DOS, even after grub4DOS has been installed. How would I make it so that grub4DOS is loaded first, and FreeDOS loaded from that menu? The process you were describing in the other thread, Wonko, where a menu entry on grub4DOS boots directly into the FreeDOS bootable would be welcome here.\n\nIn addition, although the executables show up when this version of FreeDOS is booted via floppy mode, I get the error \"You haven\u0027t got enough memory!\" It\u0027s looking bleak, so far.\n\n**Edited by Kaos-Industries, 17 July 2017 - 12:13 AM.**\n"

Even NT 4.00 does not understand FAT32.\n\nFAT32 was devised to be - while very similar overall to FAT 16 in structure - a \"new\" filesystem with a \"wider\" range of possibilities.\n\nThe physical limit in size of a FAT16 volume is - in practice - 1 Gb (it is possible to go as large as 2 Gb, but it is normally NOT advised).\n\nThere is NO IO.SYS \"in the MBR\" in your stick, actually there is no \"IO.SYS\", FreeDOS has kernel.sys as \"main OS file\".\n\nThe normal booting sequence in a MBR \"style\" device is the following:\n\nBIOS-\\\u003eMBR-\\\u003ePBR of the active partition in MBR\u0027s partition table-\\\u003eKernel.sys\n\nMultibooting is not a problem per se, but it does imply (in the case of MS-DOS 6.22) some limitations (the FAT 16 format of the volume is one of them) or - in order to avoid these limitations - the introduction of more complex \"overlays\".\n\nSome (smaller) limitations/inconveniences may be due to the desire to multiboot with 7, to boot via BOOTMGR, etc.\n\nAnd now you have to understand how each and every \"automated\" tool, such as WinsetupFromUSB or RMPREPUSB are designed to do something along a given \"path\".\n\nParticularly WinSetupFromUSB is designed to solve the issue of installing several versions of Windows from USB, and in order to do this may (or may not) need some specific setting that may (or may not) be contrasting with your declared goal of running the DOS from the stick ti run the \"specific software\" for the \"expensive hardware\".\n\nThere is no way to know without knowing the specifics of the given software.\n\nRMPREPUSB, though more \"flexible\" in some senses, suffers in part of the same issues, it defaults to some settings/ways that may (or may not) be compatible with your intended use.\n\nAnyway, as always, FORGET (temporarily) about menu.lst.\n\nGrub4dos provides a command line interface, in it you can test the commands before writing them in a menu.lst entry.\n\nThe commands needed to boot a FreeDOS (provided that the FreeDOS is installed \"normally\" in a partition of the stick are usually:\n\n```\n\nfind --set-root /kernel.sys\nchainloader /kernel.sys\nboot\n```\n\nThose commands, once tested and successful will translate in a menu.lst entry such as:\n\n```\n\ntitle Freedos \nfind --set-root /kernel.sys\nchainloader /kernel.sys\n```\n\nBut on a \"static\" USB stick, it would make more sense to hardcode the device \\*like\\*:\n\nroot (hd0,0)\n\nchainloader /kernel.sys\n\nAnyway, if the FreeDOS right now doesn\u0027t boot directly in a way suitable to run your programs, that must (should) be fixed BEFORE adding grub4dos (or anything else) to the mix.\n\nNow, be nice, forget (temporarily) about multibooting and grub4dos and anything else and just follow the given tutorial:\n\n[http://reboot.pro/to...isk-boot-image/](http://reboot.pro/topic/15839-pengos-guide-to-making-a-dos-hard-disk-boot-image/ \"\")\n\nif your QEMU install on the image works, and works correctly with your software, AND it continues working once transferred to the USB stick, THEN (and only THEN) we will add more complications, multibooting, grub4dos, etc.\n\nIF there are issues of any kind, believe me, it is better to find and solve them BEFORE adding complications to the build.\n\n![:duff:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/duff.gif)\n\nWonko\n\n"

If you can guarantee me that DOS 8.0 is closer to MS-DOS 6.22, and therefore less likely to FUBAR things than FreeDOS is, then I don\u0027t see why that\u0027s not a route I can try.

You were talking about adding layers of complexity, and I can\u0027t see how following a tutorial with whole new tools that I\u0027ve never used before - least of all, command line tools - is going to do anything but that when I\u0027m already having trouble with the basics that others have suggested like creating a FAT16 USB. If it means getting DOS 6.22, which has become a sort of challenge now, then I\u0027d consider it IF it made sense to me, but the link to QEMU from it is dead. I searched it, downloaded it, and don\u0027t even know how to boot it. Tried the QtEMU GUI, but that seems vastly outdated and doesn\u0027t have an option for DOS. More than that, the tutorial looks like it was written for someone who knows what they\u0027re doing with QEMU, and that\u0027s definitely not me. Right now, I feel like it\u0027s only going to make me rip my hair out.\n\nIs there an alternative method to go the DOS 6.22 route other than that tutorial?\n\n**Edited by Kaos-Industries, 18 July 2017 - 01:02 AM.**\n"
