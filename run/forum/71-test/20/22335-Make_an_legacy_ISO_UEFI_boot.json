      "content": "well sometimes it is possible to UEFI boot to a Linux kernel provided it makes no BIOS calls.\n\nIf you have a grub4dos menu that works you can write a grub2 menu using grub2 commands to load the kernel and initrd.\n\nFor instance, Easy2Boot v2 includes agFM (grub2) which supports user grub2 menus ( .grubfm or .cfg).\n\nSo you can try adding a .grubfm file and the ISO and have a play!\n\n"
