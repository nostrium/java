      "content": "I wanted to try installing Windows XP on my USB HDD again because it\u0027s the only most convenient solution that always worked for me (every other method hasn\u0027t worked, either it would boot to my other hard drive or will BSOD), but since 2018 Q3/2019, the website was shut down and still is with a login page that doesn\u0027t work. Does anyone have an idea as to what happened? Could it be possible to reverse-engineer USBoot software and take away the authentication key feature? I\u0027d love to use it again to try running XP on other machines without wiping their hard drive and keeping all of the data while I could load my own applications separetly or just to try running XP/2000 on any type of hardware configuration for fun. Something about using VMs takes away the fun aspect about it.\n\nI do have the last version of the USBoot.zip still saved on my hard drive.\n\n"
