      "content": "About AIO Boot\n\u003e Create a bootable USB drive or HDD with Grub2 or Clover, and integrate multiple support packages, with this minimalistic utility  \n\u003e AIO Boot is a handy utility that enables you to create a bootable USB or disk drive with Grub2, Clover or Syslinux in a few simple steps. Additionally, it allows you to boot via LAN with Tiny PXE Server and iPXE, as well as integrate multiple operating systems or support programs.  \n\u003e All in all, AIO Boot is a useful application that enables you to create bootable USB drives, hard drives or even memory cards using Grub2, Clover or Syslinux. It features a minimalistic UI with neatly organized options.  \n[See more...](http://www.softpedia.com/get/System/Boot-Manager-Disk/AIO-Boot.shtml \"External link\")  \nFeatures\n\n* For Legacy-MBR: Grub2, Grub4dos, Syslinux and Clover \\[Legacy\\].\n* For UEFI-GPT: Grub2, Clover \\[UEFI\\] and rEFInd.\n* UEFI-GPT and MBR-Legacy.\n* Supports boot into Legacy mode for the hard disk in GPT style.\n* USB and HDD with FAT32/NTFS/exFAT format.\n* Boot via LAN with Tiny PXE Server.\n* One or multiple partitions, AIO Boot also supports hidden partition.\n* Support hotkeys for Grub2. At the main menu, if you want to boot into a certain menu, simply press their hot key. For example, to restart your computer, you simply press the \"r\" or \"o\" to shutdown.\n* Supports multiple languages, including Vietnamese, English, Russian and French...\n* Multiple sets of Windows setup files- XP, 2000, 2003, Vista, WIndows 7, Server 2008, Windows 8, Server 2012, both 32 and 64 bit versions are supported. Both BIOS and (U)EFI mode are supported.\n* Support to restore the Windows bootloader for both Legacy and UEFI mode.\n* Supports installing Windows 7 on a USB 3.0 port. This will help you resolve the error: A required CD/DVD drive device driver is missing. If you have a driver floppy disk, CD, DVD, or USB flash drive, please insert it now.\n* Support to integrate the following Package: Windows, Linux, Antivirus, DOS Programs, Android, Backup \\\u0026 Recovery, Disk Tools\n* Support to edit and delete the MENU (except for Windows packages).\n* Automatically identifies the DOS program to integrate.\n* Bypass the Secure Boot on the UEFI mode via Shimx64.efi (need tester). If your computer has a Secure Boot section, turn it on, then boot /EFI/Boot/shimx64.efi.\n\nDownload\n\nOnce you have downloaded the application, you need to select the drive where the necessary files should be extracted. This should be the bootable USB or HDD you wish to create.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n++File name++ AIO_Boot_Extractor.exe  \n++Size++ 43,6 MB  \n++Version++ 0.9.1.1  \n++Last updated++ 08.11.2016  \n++MD5 Checksum++ 8861724ce95475ffeabc06c2dc40e63d  \n**Link to download:**  \n[Google Drive](http://www.sitecuatui.com/out/aiogd \"External link\") \\| [GitHub](https://github.com/nguyentumine/AIO-Boot/releases \"External link\") \\| [Softpedia](http://www.softpedia.com/get/System/Boot-Manager-Disk/AIO-Boot.shtml \"External link\") \\| [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/aioboot/ \"External link\") \\| [Fshare.vn](http://www.sitecuatui.com/out/aioboot \"External link\")  \n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSoftpedia guarantees that AIO Boot is [100% Clean](http://www.softpedia.com/get/System/Boot-Manager-Disk/AIO-Boot.shtml#status \"External link\"), which means it does not contain any form of malware, including but not limited to: spyware, viruses, trojans and backdoors.\n\nScreenShot\n\n![aio-boot-v0.9.jpg](https://a.fsdn.com/con/app/proj/aioboot/screenshots/aio-boot-v0.9.jpg)\n\n![Clover-bootloader-cua-AIO-Boot.jpg](https://a.fsdn.com/con/app/proj/aioboot/screenshots/Clover-bootloader-cua-AIO-Boot.jpg)\n\n![boot-qua-mang-lan.jpg](https://a.fsdn.com/con/app/proj/aioboot/screenshots/boot-qua-mang-lan.jpg)\n\n![aio-boot_1.png](http://i1-win.softpedia-static.com/screenshots/aio-boot_1.png)\n\n![aio-boot_2.png](http://i1-win.softpedia-static.com/screenshots/aio-boot_2.png)\n\n![aio-boot_3.png](http://i1-win.softpedia-static.com/screenshots/aio-boot_3.png)\n\n![aio-boot_4.png](http://i1-win.softpedia-static.com/screenshots/aio-boot_4.png)\n\n![cai-dat-va-khoi-phuc-bootloader.jpg](https://a.fsdn.com/con/app/proj/aioboot/screenshots/cai-dat-va-khoi-phuc-bootloader.jpg)\n\n![chia-usb-thanh-2-o.jpg](https://a.fsdn.com/con/app/proj/aioboot/screenshots/chia-usb-thanh-2-o.jpg)\n\nPackages are supported\n\nWinPE \\\u0026 Setup\n\n1.

Additionally, it allows you to boot via LAN with Tiny PXE Server and iPXE, as well as integrate multiple operating systems or support programs.  \n\u003e All in all, AIO Boot is a useful application that enables you to create bootable USB drives, hard drives or even memory cards using Grub2, Clover or Syslinux. It features a minimalistic UI with neatly organized options.  \n[See more...](http://www.softpedia.com/get/System/Boot-Manager-Disk/AIO-Boot.shtml \"External link\")  \nFeatures\n\n* For Legacy-MBR: Grub2, Grub4dos, Syslinux and Clover \\[Legacy\\].\n* For UEFI-GPT: Grub2, Clover \\[UEFI\\] and rEFInd.\n* UEFI-GPT and MBR-Legacy.\n* Supports boot into Legacy mode for the hard disk in GPT style.\n* USB and HDD with FAT32/NTFS/exFAT format.\n* Boot via LAN with Tiny PXE Server.\n* One or multiple partitions, AIO Boot also supports hidden partition.\n* Support hotkeys for Grub2. At the main menu, if you want to boot into a certain menu, simply press their hot key. For example, to restart your computer, you simply press the \"r\" or \"o\" to shutdown.\n* Supports multiple languages, including Vietnamese, English, Russian and French...\n* Multiple sets of Windows setup files- XP, 2000, 2003, Vista, WIndows 7, Server 2008, Windows 8, Server 2012, both 32 and 64 bit versions are supported. Both BIOS and (U)EFI mode are supported.\n* Support to restore the Windows bootloader for both Legacy and UEFI mode.\n* Supports installing Windows 7 on a USB 3.0 port. This will help you resolve the error: A required CD/DVD drive device driver is missing.

I don\u0027t want Windows 8 or 8.1 in my AIO so can I skip step number 7 of copying sources folder and setup.exe files in the that partition or it is essential?\n\nAs per current testing it\u0027s looking that NTBOOT is full compatible upto Windows 8.1 \u0027bootmgr\u0027. Just copy those files we will check Windows 10 bootmgr to see if which version of Windows 10 will be supportable. I think initial Windows 10 Builds is supportable...?\n\n\u003e 3. Can I use my already created AIO, I have copied all the files of 30GB AIO partition when I was experimenting earlier? Though I would copy AIO and EFI folder and AIOcreator.exe, boot7 and partIMGmapper.exe files only.\n\nYou can do it...But it will be better to start from beginning to avoid and any conflict in MBR code...\n\n\u003e 4. I am unable to download NTBOOT.zip I am getting following message................. ![:wacko:](https://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/wacko.png) ![:wacko:](https://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/wacko.png) ![:wacko:](https://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/wacko.png)\n\nIt is working for me. May be you was trying to download from previous link...I had updated it in between...Just refresh page and download...\n\n"
