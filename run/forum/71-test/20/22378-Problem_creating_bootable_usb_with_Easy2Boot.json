      "content": "I downloaded Easy2Boot and created bootable usb using the auto+defaults option. In the end, in the power shell prompt, it showed a line like this: \"add alive grub2 file manager...\" which i wasn\u0027t sure what it means so i just pressed \u0027Enter\u0027.\n\nThen i copy openSUSE netinstall .iso to the Linux folder, run \u0027make this drive contiguous\u0027 batch script and tested the usb with \u0027QEMU_MENU_TEST\u0027 script and everything went fine without any errors.\n\nBut when i boot the usb it shows a black screen with the message: \"Missing MBR-Helper\". What this error mean?\n\n"
