With ventoy, you don\u0027t need to format the disk again and again, you just need to copy the iso file to the USB drive and boot it. You can copy many iso files at a time and ventoy will give you a boot menu to select them ([screenshot](http://www.ventoy.net/screenshot.html \"External link\")). Both Legacy BIOS and UEFI are supported in the same way. 160+ ISO files are tested ([list](http://www.ventoy.net/isolist.html \"External link\")).  \nA \"Ventoy Compatible\" concept is introduced by ventoy, which can help to support any ISO file.\n\n**Features**\n\n**100% open source**\n\n**Simple to use**\n\n**Fast (limited only by the speed of copying iso file)**\n\n**Directly boot from iso file, no extraction needed**\n\n**Legacy + UEFI supported in the same way**\n\n**ISO files larger than 4GB supported**\n\n**Native boot menu style for Legacy \\\u0026 UEFI**\n\n**Most type of OS supported, 160+ iso files tested**\n\n**Not only boot but also complete installation process**\n\n**\"Ventoy Compatible\" concept**\n\n**Plugin Framework**\n\n**Readonly to USB drive during boot**\n\n**USB normal use unafftected**\n\n**Data nondestructive during version upgrade**\n\n**No need to update Ventoy when a new distro is released**\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n"

If not so, you have to think of some way to make the file contiguous, such as recopy the file to a reserved contiguous area or defragment the disk.  \n\u003e Ventoy has no such limitation. Ventoy doesn\u0027t care about whether the file is contiguous on disk or not.

So is there a large memory requirement or does it point to the actual file?  \n---NO  \nDoes the file need to be contiguous?  \n---NO  \nTake lagacy bios for example. You may be very familiar with grub4dos\u0027s map and syslinux\u0027s memdisk. They both use the int13 hook mechanism.  \nA virtual device with drive number 0x81 (for example) will be created. When the int13 request for the virtual device come, they response it with data from memory or  \njust change the drive number and sector to get the data from the original file in disk 0x80(for example)  \nVentoy also use int13 hook, to be exactly some thing can be called int13 relay. Before the virtual device was created. All the sector\u0027s location of the original iso file  \nwill be found(something like grub2\u0027s blocklist command).  \nSo the virtual device can be mapped as follows:  \nVirtualCDROM Physical Disk  \nLBA 0 LBA 100  \nLBA 1 LBA 121  \nLBA 2 LBA 133  \nLBA 3 LBA 140  \n......  \nSo when the int13 request for the virtual device come, Ventoy look for the map table, and re-call int13 with a new drive number and new LBA for every LBA (contiguous LBA can be merged).  \nAll the above are the first level virtualization of Ventoy.  \nTake LBA0 of the VirtualCDROM for example, when the request come, I can recall int13 to get the data of LBA100 of the physical disk and response it.  \nOn the other hand, I can also fill it with my own data and response it.  \nBesides, the map table is not One-to-one correspondence to the original iso file. The virtual device is bigger than the original iso file.  \nThe extra data after the data mapped to the original iso file is virtual. When the int13 request for these virtual data come, ventoy will fill them directly and reponse it.  \nThe extra data is just the hook. But if you just append some data after an iso file, it will not take affect. So ventoy will parse the ISO9660 or UDF file system, and find the location of  \nkey data which corresponding to the location and length of initrd(linux) or boot.wim(windows), and modify it before response the corresponding int13 request.  \nVentoy modify the location and length and point it to the extra data at the tail of the virtual iso file.\n\n"

With ventoy, you don\u0027t need to format the disk again and again, you just need to copy the iso file to the USB drive and boot it. You can copy many iso files at a time and ventoy will give you a boot menu to select them ([screenshot](http://www.ventoy.net/screenshot.html \"External link\")). Both Legacy BIOS and UEFI are supported in the same way. 160+ ISO files are tested ([list](http://www.ventoy.net/isolist.html \"External link\")).  \nA \"Ventoy Compatible\" concept is introduced by ventoy, which can help to support any ISO file.\n\n**Features**\n\n**100% open source**\n\n**Simple to use**\n\n**Fast (limited only by the speed of copying iso file)**\n\n**Directly boot from iso file, no extraction needed**\n\n**Legacy + UEFI supported in the same way**\n\n**ISO files larger than 4GB supported**\n\n**Native boot menu style for Legacy \\\u0026 UEFI**\n\n**Most type of OS supported, 160+ iso files tested**\n\n**Not only boot but also complete installation process**\n\n**\"Ventoy Compatible\" concept**\n\n**Plugin Framework**\n\n**Readonly to USB drive during boot**\n\n**USB normal use unafftected**\n\n**Data nondestructive during version upgrade**\n\n**No need to update Ventoy when a new distro is released**\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n"

You may be very familiar with grub4dos\u0027s map and syslinux\u0027s memdisk. They both use the int13 hook mechanism.  \nA virtual device with drive number 0x81 (for example) will be created. When the int13 request for the virtual device come, they response it with data from memory or  \njust change the drive number and sector to get the data from the original file in disk 0x80(for example)  \nVentoy also use int13 hook, to be exactly some thing can be called int13 relay. Before the virtual device was created. All the sector\u0027s location of the original iso file  \nwill be found(something like grub2\u0027s blocklist command).  \nSo the virtual device can be mapped as follows:  \nVirtualCDROM Physical Disk  \nLBA 0 LBA 100  \nLBA 1 LBA 121  \nLBA 2 LBA 133  \nLBA 3 LBA 140  \n......  \nSo when the int13 request for the virtual device come, Ventoy look for the map table, and re-call int13 with a new drive number and new LBA for every LBA (contiguous LBA can be merged).  \nAll the above are the first level virtualization of Ventoy.  \nTake LBA0 of the VirtualCDROM for example, when the request come, I can recall int13 to get the data of LBA100 of the physical disk and response it.  \nOn the other hand, I can also fill it with my own data and response it.  \nBesides, the map table is not One-to-one correspondence to the original iso file. The virtual device is bigger than the original iso file.  \nThe extra data after the data mapped to the original iso file is virtual. When the int13 request for these virtual data come, ventoy will fill them directly and reponse it.  \nThe extra data is just the hook. But if you just append some data after an iso file, it will not take affect. So ventoy will parse the ISO9660 or UDF file system, and find the location of  \nkey data which corresponding to the location and length of initrd(linux) or boot.wim(windows), and modify it before response the corresponding int13 request.  \nVentoy modify the location and length and point it to the extra data at the tail of the virtual iso file.\n\n"

I chose 64-bit and then it could not find the \u0027DVD\u0027 and asked for a CD\\\\DVD driver to be installed.\n\nThe same test with a single architecture 64-bit Win10 ISO worked however and I think it also accepted the XML file as it assumed a Pro edition was requested and did not prompt me to select an Edition.\n\n```\n{\n    \"auto_install\" : [\n        {\n            \"image\": \"/ISO/Windows10_2020_04_20_UK_Both.iso\",\n            \"template\": \"/ISO/windows_10_Pro.xml\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"image\": \"/ISO/Windows10x64UK.iso\",\n            \"template\": \"/ISO/windows_10_Pro.xml\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"image\": \"/000/centos.iso\",\n            \"template\": \"/ventoy/script/centos_kickstart.cfg\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"image\": \"/SLE-12-SP3-Server-DVD-x86_64-GM-DVD1.iso\",\n            \"template\": \"/ventoy/script/suse_autoyast.xml\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"image\": \"/ubuntu-16.04-server-amd64.iso\",\n            \"template\": \"/ventoy/script/ubuntu_server.seed\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nSo presumably I can have the XML on the exFAT volume and it does not have to be in the FAT partition?\n\nSo there are a few Q\u0027s:\n\n1. Why can\u0027t I boot to a Windows ISO in VBOX when other grub2 solutions just work and have no problem? It makes it very awkward to test!\n\n2. Why can\u0027t we have spaces in Windows ISO filenames (and are they allowed in XML filenames)?\n\n3. Why don\u0027t standard Microsoft Dual Architecture x86\\\\x64 Install ISOs work?\n\n4. How can I have one Windows 10 ISO but select from a range of different XML files?\n\n5. Why is the 2nd partition made as an EFI type MBR partition so that it is very difficult to add/edit files on it under Windows?\n\n6. Can the ventoy.json file be placed on the exFAT partition (in a \\\\ventoy folder)?\n\nHTH\n\nSteve\n\n"

I chose 64-bit and then it could not find the \u0027DVD\u0027 and asked for a CD\\\\DVD driver to be installed.\n\u003e\n\u003e The same test with a single architecture 64-bit Win10 ISO worked however and I think it also accepted the XML file as it assumed a Pro edition was requested and did not prompt me to select an Edition.\n\u003e\n\u003e ```\n\u003e {\n\u003e     \"auto_install\" : [\n\u003e         {\n\u003e             \"image\": \"/ISO/Windows10_2020_04_20_UK_Both.iso\",\n\u003e             \"template\": \"/ISO/windows_10_Pro.xml\"\n\u003e         },\n\u003e         {\n\u003e             \"image\": \"/ISO/Windows10x64UK.iso\",\n\u003e             \"template\": \"/ISO/windows_10_Pro.xml\"\n\u003e         },\n\u003e         {\n\u003e             \"image\": \"/000/centos.iso\",\n\u003e             \"template\": \"/ventoy/script/centos_kickstart.cfg\"\n\u003e         },\n\u003e         {\n\u003e             \"image\": \"/SLE-12-SP3-Server-DVD-x86_64-GM-DVD1.iso\",\n\u003e             \"template\": \"/ventoy/script/suse_autoyast.xml\"\n\u003e         },\n\u003e         {\n\u003e             \"image\": \"/ubuntu-16.04-server-amd64.iso\",\n\u003e             \"template\": \"/ventoy/script/ubuntu_server.seed\"\n\u003e         }\n\u003e     ]\n\u003e }\n\u003e ```\n\u003e\n\u003e So presumably I can have the XML on the exFAT volume and it does not have to be in the FAT partition?\n\u003e\n\u003e So there are a few Q\u0027s:\n\u003e\n\u003e 1. Why can\u0027t I boot to a Windows ISO in VBOX when other grub2 solutions just work and have no problem? It makes it very awkward to test!\n\u003e\n\u003e 2. Why can\u0027t we have spaces in Windows ISO filenames (and are they allowed in XML filenames)?\n\u003e\n\u003e 3. Why don\u0027t standard Microsoft Dual Architecture x86\\\\x64 Install ISOs work?\n\u003e\n\u003e 4. How can I have one Windows 10 ISO but select from a range of different XML files?\n\u003e\n\u003e 5. Why is the 2nd partition made as an EFI type MBR partition so that it is very difficult to add/edit files on it under Windows?\n\u003e\n\u003e 6. Can the ventoy.json file be placed on the exFAT partition (in a \\\\ventoy folder)?\n\u003e\n\u003e HTH\n\u003e\n\u003e Steve\n\nHi,\n\nYes, you should create a ventoy directory in the first partition and put a ventoy.json file in it. The json file is also the entrypoint for all plugins.\n\nAll of these are explained on the website.\n\nAs for the space in the file name, I have explained in both document and the FAQ, it is just an artificial limitation in current version, I will fixed it in the future release.\n\n1. Why can\u0027t I boot to a Windows ISO in VBOX when other grub2 solutions just work and have no problem? It makes it very awkward to test!\n\n----- You reported it before, I hava no idea about it. I tested ventoy with latest version of VBOX and it worked well.\n\n2. Why can\u0027t we have spaces in Windows ISO filenames (and are they allowed in XML filenames)?\n\n----- see the explanation above\n\n3. Why don\u0027t standard Microsoft Dual Architecture x86\\\\x64 Install ISOs work?\n\n----- You reported it before, Maybe it\u0027s a BUG in current release, I will check it.\n\n4. How can I have one Windows 10 ISO but select from a range of different XML files?\n\n----- Currently you need to modify the json file, If needed I can provide a dynamic menu to select them before boot, it\u0027s simple.\n\n5. Why is the 2nd partition made as an EFI type MBR partition so that it is very difficult to add/edit files on it under Windows?\n\n----- I explained in detail why in the website, you can see [https://www.ventoy.n...isk_layout.html](https://www.ventoy.net/en/doc_disk_layout.html \"External link\")\n\n6. Can the ventoy.json file be placed on the exFAT partition (in a \\\\ventoy folder)?\n\n----- see the explanation above\n\nVentoy was only a month old, and inevitably there will be some problems. So please give me more time :smile:\n\n"

      "content": "\u003e How does it work?\n\nWith apologies to **longpanda** /**ventoy**, and since I was curious about it myself, let me detail my findings (which I hope are relatively accurate, but may of course contain errors that I\u0027ll be happy to see corrected).\n\nThe one prerequisite you need to know is the great explanation **steve6375** gave [here](http://reboot.pro/topic/22022-outline-of-the-winpe-boot-process-winpeshl-setupexe-startnetcmd-etc/ \"\") of the outline of WinPE boot process (but even then, the only thing that really matters is that winpeshl.exe is the first executable that is being run during an installation process).\n\n1. As you already know, when a Ventoy bootable drive boots, it boots in a custom version of GRUB 2.04 with [extra ventoy features added](https://github.com/ventoy/Ventoy/tree/master/GRUB2/grub-2.04/grub-core/ventoy \"External link\"). This presents the user with the choice of ISOs, and also allows you to add some additional options when booting, such as vt_debug on, which (if you add it through GRUB\u0027s e command before you boot the currenty selected image) allows you to get some very informative details on what Ventoy does.\n2. If a Windows ISO is selected, the first thing Ventoy does (as part of its GRUB extension) is:\n   1. Open boot.wim from the ISO\n   2.

Then, if users still want to execute non Secure Boot signed media, they still can do that, but it will become very explicit if the ISO they are trying to boot is actually Secure Boot compliant or not, which, for users who actually care about Secure Boot, is what you want.  \n2. No matter how much I trust Ventoy (which, after having talked extensively to his friendly developer and looked at the source I most certainly do) I **really** don\u0027t like the idea the idea of enrolling somebody else\u0027s single global certificate into my machine\u0027s Secure Boot store, because you never know if the private key associated with that certificate might be stolen by a third party and used for nefarious purposes.  \n\n   Unfortunately, unlike the above, there\u0027s no good solution to that problem, though one could provide an option for Ventoy2Disk users that could: Generate a new credential, sign the Ventoy bootx64.efi executable with this credential, **destroy the private key** (since it should only ever be used to sign that executable and nothing else), and then copy the certificate to the Ventoy ESP to replace ENROLL_THIS_KEY_IN_MOKMANAGER.cer. The problem of course is that, if you do that, then you have to re-enroll the new key every time Ventoy is updated, which isn\u0027t ideal.

This presents the user with the choice of ISOs, and also allows you to add some additional options when booting, such as vt_debug on, which (if you add it through GRUB\u0027s e command before you boot the currenty selected image) allows you to get some very informative details on what Ventoy does.\n\u003e 2. If a Windows ISO is selected, the first thing Ventoy does (as part of its GRUB extension) is:\n\u003e    1. Open boot.wim from the ISO\n\u003e    2.

If only ventoy.cpio is loaded with the kernel, there will be no driver to access the disk and other hardware.  \nAs for the checksum, after the kernel was booted, the virtual cdrom is gone. And ventoy creates a device-mapper based on the original iso file.  \nSo the checksum will be OK, there is no workaround in Ubuntu 20.04, the checksum is indeed match with the iso file.  \nThe secure boot solution in Ventoy is not so good. It really needs serious discussion, private discussion is welcome.\n\n"

I still would like to know more about the Linux boot process though. ![:unsure:](https://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/unsure.png)\n\nWhat worries me is just how \u0027universal\u0027 the Linux approach is since there are a lot of reports of \u0027it doesn\u0027t work with ISO xyz\u0027 and then Ventoy has fixed the problem. So, in the future, do we have to keep asking ventoy and any fellow developers to add patches to cope with the next distro that comes out, and the next, and the next, etc.\n\nWhilst I admit that the partnew approach used in E2B and now a1ive\u0027s grub2 is a clumsy approach which requires writeable-media, MBR partitions, free partition and a contiguous ISO file - at least it will work on 99% of ISOs and it has not needed any \u0027patches\u0027 to boot Linux ISOs in over six years.\n\nOn another note:\n\nThe Secure Boot fix relies on MokManager which I have found to be very unreliable - it either does not work or crashes on many different systems.

So, in the future, do we have to keep asking ventoy and any fellow developers to add patches to cope with the next distro that comes out, and the next, and the next, etc.\n\u003e\n\u003e Whilst I admit that the partnew approach used in E2B and now a1ive\u0027s grub2 is a clumsy approach which requires writeable-media, MBR partitions, free partition and a contiguous ISO file - at least it will work on 99% of ISOs and it has not needed any \u0027patches\u0027 to boot Linux ISOs in over six years.\n\u003e\n\u003e On another note:\n\u003e\n\u003e The Secure Boot fix relies on MokManager which I have found to be very unreliable - it either does not work or crashes on many different systems.

For example, all the centos 7.X and 8.X share the same initramfs structure. So it doesn\u0027t need to update ventoy all the time.\n\n"

Expand the configuration, now you can specify more than one persistence backend image files for one ISO file\n\u003e    2. Add a prompt for the iso with persistence config, you can choose whether to use the persistence image and which one to use for this time\n\u003e 4. Change the 1st partition active and 2nd partition inactive by default (compatibility improvement).\n\u003e 5. Move the position of the red Memdisk tip to a more prominent position\n\u003e 6. Add a return parent directory item when in TreeView mode\n\u003e 7. Add a VTOY_DEFAULT_SEARCH_ROOT option in [global control plugin](https://www.ventoy.net/en/plugin_control.html \"External link\") to specify the root path of the iso files.\n\u003e 8. Change the style of F2 power menu\n\u003e 9. Fix a bug about Ventoy2Disk.exe can\u0027t start when there is a DataRAM Ramdisk in the system.\n\u003e 10. Files with size less than 32KB will be filted by default\n\u003e 11. Fix a bug about wrong file size in TreeView mode with NTFS/XFS\n\u003e 12. Files with space or Non Ascii charactors in name will be shown but with unsupported message when you boot it.\n\u003e 13. Optimization for Ventoy2Disk.sh\n\u003e 14. Optimization for arch linux boot\n\u003e 15. New iso support\n\u003e     * android-x86_64-9.0-r2.iso (Legacy + UEFI)\n\u003e     * manjaro-xfce-20.0.1-200511-linux56.iso (Legacy + UEFI)\n\n**Source:** [https://www.ventoy.n...n/doc_news.html](https://www.ventoy.net/en/doc_news.html \"External link\")\n\n**Wimboot Plugin:**\n\n\u003e Ventoy use this plugin to boot WIM files (Legacy BIOS + UEFI).\n\u003e\n\u003e * How to use\n\u003e\n\u003e Download ventoy_wimboot.img file from [https://github.com/v...wimiso/releases](https://github.com/ventoy/wimiso/releases \"External link\")  \n\u003e Put the file under ventoy directory in the first partition of the USB stick, that is /ventoy/ventoy_wimboot.img and that\u0027s all.\n\u003e\n\u003e * Features\n\u003e\n\u003e There is no need to read the whole wim file to memory for both Legacy BIOS and UEFI. So no memory will be wasted.\n\u003e\n\u003e etfsboot.com + bootx64.efi directly extracted from Windows ISO file\n\u003e\n\u003e There are many configurations in bcd file in ventoy_wimboot.img. For example, digital signature, test mode ...  \n\u003e You can customize them if the default template doesn\u0027t match your requirement.\n\u003e\n\u003e 1. Directly boot from disk, no additional memory needed (Legacy + UEFI)\n\u003e 2. Use Windows native bootloader (Legacy + UEFI)\n\u003e 3. You can customize ventoy_wimboot.img as you need\n\u003e\n\u003e * Why not out-of-box support\n\u003e\n\u003e This feature was not integrated by Ventoy. The main considerations are:  \n\u003e 1. bootmgr, bcd, boot.sdi ... These files in ventoy_wimboot.img are NOT open source, they are directly extracted from Windows ISO file.  \n\u003e 2. Easy to update ventoy_wimboot.img separately  \n\u003e 3. Easy to customize ventoy_wimboot.img\n\n**Source:** [https://www.ventoy.n...in_wimboot.html](https://www.ventoy.net/en/plugin_wimboot.html \"External link\")\n\nalacran\n\n"

According to which jurisdiction\u0027s law? Irish (where you\u0027re posting)? EU? USA, where MS is incorporated? International? If so, which treaty/convention, and how widely adopted/ratified? If the rights MS is depending on are ones that MS asserts in its own particular EULAs, rather than more generally applicable legislation, have they actually been tested in court? If so, again, in what jurisdictions? Does MS only take action against large corporations like HP, or are there any known cases of take-down notices being sent to small players like yourself?\n\nI\u0027m asking because I seem to have a vague recollection -- do not rely on this, anyone, IANAL -- that there is some precedent for a court accepting that MS was in practice so lax on enforcement that they could be held to be in tacit collusion with piracy of their own product. (The reason for their laxity is said to be because they prefer you to have a pirated copy of their software to a licit copy of someone else\u0027s, so long as nobody is making money, in order to maintain their monopoly -- monopoly being a crime of which MS definitely has been convicted in US federal court).\n\nAnyway, just to be clear, I am not advocating or recommending that anyone circulate MS binaries without MS\u0027 permission, if for no other reason than that, right or wrong, just or unjust, smart or stupid, innovative and beneficial or damaging and evil, MS has a lot of money and lawyers and politicians and editors, and the guy with more money almost always wins in a legal fight.\n\nThe prospect of MS execs arbitrarily shutting down Github projects is exactly why I have taken my code off Github and moved it to a more open and freedom-respecting service, and I urge everyone to act similarly.\n\nThere\u0027s a lot of naive lauding of MS for its current moves around open source. (Notice that they still can\u0027t bring themselves to say \"free software\"). As if MS would make those moves if they still had any other choice! MS fought long, hard and very, very dirty, at tremendous cost to more talented, more ethical people, and they lost. They tried every kind of malicious and underhanded scheme they could think of; they lost. We beat them, and we didn\u0027t even have to try. MS\u0027 malignity was utterly defeated by the one thing they could not control through monopolist licensing: freedom-respecting software.\n\nListen to us greybeards: once a scorpion, always a scorpion. Do not trust Microsoft. Ever. It only exists because of the crime of monopoly. All that money came from the denial of choice to the market, not free choice by the market. Nobody ever chose Microsoft, and everybody inside Microsoft knows it. Don\u0027t be surprised when the scorpion stings; it can\u0027t help it. It just has to, sooner or later. Try not to be the one being stung. Make and use better software that everyone is irrevocably free to use, read, change and distribute.\n\n"

      "content": "\u003e Not saying you\u0027re wrong\n\nI\u0027m not. But you are clearly trying to imply that I am.  \n\u003e but can you be more precise?\n\nI don\u0027t have to. Try to distribute one of the Windows ISOs, even the ones that Microsoft publicly provides, from one of your servers, wherever you want to locate it, and see how long it takes for Microsoft to send a DMCA to your hosting provider. If you spend some time looking for Windows ISO content or Microsoft copyrighted content, you will find tons of notices about \"this link has been removed due to DMCA\". Or I can just point to [this link](https://www.lumendatabase.org/notices/search?utf8\u003d%E2%9C%93\u0026term\u003dwindows+10\u0026sort_by\u003d \"External link\").  \n\nIf that\u0027s the point you are trying to make, there is no legal difference between distributing a collection of copyrighted works you have no right to distribute or a single copyrighted work. It\u0027s be like saying *\"Well, I was only distributing one song from artist X on my server! It\u0027s not like I was redistributing the whole album...\"* . That is not going to fly in any court of law, regardless of jurisdiction, because international copyright laws are well defined at this stage and do apply.  \n\nOh, and you can try to claim *\"fair use\"* or *\"but I\u0027m not trying to profit from it!\"* and see where that takes you.  \n\nIf you want to prove the point that Microsoft won\u0027t do anything if you redistribute one of their copyrighted files, and want to disprove what I am stating, then please go ahead and publicly announce that *\"I, **dije**, will be redistributing this specific Microsoft copyrighted file, not for profit and on the grounds of what I believe to be fair use. You can download it from my server at this URL\"* . In other words, the onus is on **you** to prove me wrong, and not on me to demonstrate that *\"In every single case where someone published a Microsoft copyrighted file, Microsoft issued a DMCA\"* , which isn\u0027t actually the point I am making and which, of course is not something that can be demonstrated, especially as I am confident that, as I said, there exist many many cases that will fly under Microsoft\u0027s radar.  \n\u003e I\u0027m asking because I seem to have a vague recollection -- do not rely on this, anyone, IANAL -- that there is some precedent for a court accepting that MS was in practice so lax on enforcement that they could be held to be in tacit collusion with piracy of their own product. (The reason for their laxity is said to be because they prefer you to have a pirated copy of their software to a licit copy of someone else\u0027s, so long as nobody is making money, in order to maintain their monopoly -- monopoly being a crime of which MS definitely has been convicted in US federal court).\n\nAh, yes, the old *\"I\u0027ve heard that there might have been some instance of something that went in my way... too bad I can\u0027t actually point to anything that corroborates what I am asserting\"* .  \n\nFor someone asking somebody else to demonstrate their assertion (which I did with the DMCA notices for Microsoft copyrighted work above), you sure are light with regards to tangible evidence for the point you are trying to make.  \n\nMy statement is not based on hear say, but on actual instances that I have seen happening. If you look hard enough, I would assert that you can still find some copies of the HPUSBFW floating around with the MS-DOS files, and then newer versions where it was removed. And again, as I have shown above, MS DMCA notices are literally a dime a dozen.\n\nOn the other hand, your assertion is pure hear and say.  \n\u003e Anyway, just to be clear, I am not advocating or recommending that anyone circulate MS binaries without MS\u0027 permission (...)\n\nYet it does seem to me like you do believe that there are legal exceptions to do so.\n\nUntil proven otherwise (with the onus on **you** to find a public legal case where that actually happened because, in this instance, you only have to find a **single** example, as opposed to what you asked me to demonstrate, that in every possible instance and jurisdiction, Microsoft will go against redistribution of their work), there is no legal framework or precedent where anyone that hasn\u0027t entered a redistribution agreement with Microsoft, is entitled, **even implicitly** , to publish binaries that are copyrighted by Microsoft that aren\u0027t also subject to a non-proprietary license (since Microsoft does sometime publish Open Source work, but that is a different matter, and the files we are talking about clearly do not fall under that category).  \n\u003e The prospect of MS execs arbitrarily shutting down Github projects is exactly why I have taken my code off Github and moved it to a more open and freedom-respecting service, and I urge everyone to act similarly.\n\nI wouldn\u0027t go that far.\n\nAs long as you do take copyright seriously and don\u0027t try to brush it under the carpet with the hope that, maybe, the owner of the copyrighted work will just let it slide, you will be fine with GitHub...\n\nHowever, with Microsoft now owning GitHub, one can easily imagine them having a script, that parses the content of every single GitHub repo for binaries that contain a \"Copyright Microsoft\", to flag them for closer inspection, and potential removal or repo shutdown...  \n\u003e There\u0027s a lot of naive lauding of MS for its current moves around open source. (Notice that they still can\u0027t bring themselves to say \"free software\"). As if MS would make those moves if they still had any other choice! MS fought long, hard and very, very dirty, at tremendous cost to more talented, more ethical people, and they lost. They tried every kind of malicious and underhanded scheme they could think of; they lost. We beat them, and we didn\u0027t even have to try. MS\u0027 malignity was utterly defeated by the one thing they could not control through monopolist licensing: freedom-respecting software.  \n\u003e\n\u003e Listen to us greybeards: once a scorpion, always a scorpion. Do not trust Microsoft. Ever. It only exists because of the crime of monopoly. All that money came from the denial of choice to the market, not free choice by the market. Nobody ever chose Microsoft, and everybody inside Microsoft knows it. Don\u0027t be surprised when the scorpion stings; it can\u0027t help it. It just has to, sooner or later. Try not to be the one being stung. Make and use better software that everyone is irrevocably free to use, read, change and distribute.\n\nI am actually not sure if you are being ironic here.\n\nMicrosoft has made a lot of strides towards Open Source, but as far as I\u0027m concerned, as long as they forcibly continue to prevent anything GPLv3 from being signed for Secure Boot, even as they happily sign shims that in turn allow GPLv3 binaries to be executed in a Secure Boot environment (which, logically, completely invalidates their alleged \"reasoning\" for not wanting to sign GPLv3 because it would force them to relinquish keys and leave Secure Boot wide open), it remains pretty clear that, yes, some of their *\"We\u0027re friendly to Open Source now!\"* message is just a facade.\n\n"

You only need UEFI + GPT partinion/format on disks bigger than 2 GB.\n\nalacran\n\n"

I just tried a 32GB SanDisk USB 3.0 flash drive and my notebook boots ventoy perfectly in UEFI mode.\n\u003e\n\u003e Shame that the 128GB one doesn\u0027t work on all systems, but 32GB is enough to have the most important ISO\u0027s on there.\n\nI have never heard of a 128GB limit in UEFI firmware. MBR\\\\Legacy BIOS - yes - it is common, but never UEFI because the USB driver should be written to handle large drives.\n\nI would not jump to conclusions just yet!\n\nPlease report all details about the system (Make, Model, BIOS revision, RAM, USB ports, how you made the USB stick, dump of partition table, etc.) - e.g. RMPrepUSB - Drive Info - 0.\n\nI have seen issues where the partition table is \u0027invalid\u0027 because the partitions overlap or are out-of-order.\n\nSo maybe more experimentation is required:\n\n1. Try all available USB ports (USB2 and USB 3, rear, left,right,front)\n\n2. Try other systems with the \u0027bad\u0027 USB stick\n\n3. Try a different 128GB USB stick\n\n4. Wipe the current 128GB stick and remake it\n\n"

      "content": "The funny thing about that is, that my 128GB flash drive works perfectly on my notebook in legacy mode.\n\nBut in the boot menu it does not show up as an EFI device, only legacy.\n\nEven crazier is, that it shows up as an EFI device in the UEFI BIOS boot settings and I can move it to the top of the boot order. It baffles me that it shows up there, but not in the boot menu on bootup. Secure Boot is of course disabled.\n\nThe device is a 2013 Lenovo Ideapad Yoga 2 Pro. It only has 2 USB ports. One is 2.0 and the other is 3.0 and it has the same behavior on both ports.\n\nIt has 8gb RAM, i5-4200U, BIOS Revision 3.7.\n\nI made the stick on Windows 10 64 Bit 1903 at first with ventoy 1.0.10 with secure boot disabled in the dropdown menu. Then I updated it to 1.0.12 recently and it changed nothing.\n\n1. I tried both USB ports, no changes\n2. My main desktop PC runs fine with the 128gb stick in UEFI mode\n3. I currently don\u0027t have another 128gb stick here\n4. Already did, nothing changed.\n\nHere is the drive info file, I couldn\u0027t attach it as a file, so I hope just code tags is ok:\n\n```\nCOMMAND LINE: DRIVE\u003d2 USBINFO USBSTART\u003d0 SURE \n\nRMPARTUSB v2.1.747 (c)2019 RM Education plc [SSi]\n\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\n\nAccessing Drive 2 - \"Verbatim STORE N GO\" (125,829,120,000 bytes)\n\nSector at LBA 0\n\n\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d SECTOR DATA \u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\n\n\n[Sector 0]  0MB\n0000 EB 63 90 00 00 00 00 00 - 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  Îcê..... ........\n0010 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 - 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ........ ........\n0020 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 - 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ........ ........\n0030 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 - 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ........ ........\n0040 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 - 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ........ ........\n0050 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 - 00 00 00 80 01 00 00 00  ........ ...Ä....\n0060 00 00 00 00 FF FA 90 90 - F6 C2 80 74 05 F6 C2 70  ....ˇ˙êê ˆ¬Ät.ˆ¬p\n0070 74 02 B2 80 EA 79 7C 00 - 00 31 C0 8E D8 8E D0 BC  t.≤ÄÍy|. .1¿éÿé–º\n0080 00 20 FB A0 64 7C 3C FF - 74 02 88 C2 52 BE 90 7D  . ˚†d|\u003cˇ t.à¬Ræê}\n0090 E8 16 01 BE 05 7C B4 41 - BB AA 55 CD 13 5A 52 72  Ë.æ.|¥A ª™UÕZRr\n00A0 3D 81 FB 55 AA 75 37 83 - E1 01 74 32 31 C0 89 44  \u003dÅ˚U™u7É ·.t21¿âD\n00B0 04 40 88 44 FF 89 44 02 - C7 04 10 00 66 8B 1E 5C  .@àDˇâD. «..fã\\\n00C0 7C 66 89 5C 08 66 8B 1E - 60 7C 66 89 5C 0C C7 44  |fâ\\.fã `|fâ\\.«D\n00D0 06 00 70 B4 42 CD 13 72 - 05 BB 00 70 EB 76 B4 08  ..p¥BÕr .ª.pÎv¥.\n00E0 CD 13 73 0D 5A 84 D2 0F - 83 D8 00 BE 96 7D E9 82  Õs.ZÑ“ Éÿ.æñ}ÈÇ\n00F0 00 66 0F B6 C6 88 64 FF - 40 66 89 44 04 0F B6 D1  .f∂∆àdˇ @fâD.∂—\n0100 C1 E2 02 88 E8 88 F4 40 - 89 44 08 0F B6 C2 C0 E8  ¡‚.àËàÙ@ âD.∂¬¿Ë\n0110 02 66 89 04 66 A1 60 7C - 66 09 C0 75 4E 66 A1 5C  .fâ.f°`| f.¿uNf°\\\n0120 7C 66 31 D2 66 F7 34 88 - D1 31 D2 66 F7 74 04 3B  |f1“f˜4à —1“f˜t.;\n0130 44 08 7D 37 FE C1 88 C5 - 30 C0 C1 E8 02 08 C1 88  D.}7˛¡à≈ 0¿¡Ë..¡à\n0140 D0 5A 88 C6 BB 00 70 8E - C3 31 DB B8 01 02 CD 13  –Zà∆ª.pé √1€∏..Õ\n0150 72 1E 8C C3 60 1E B9 00 - 01 8E DB 31 F6 BF 00 80  rå√`π. .é€1ˆø.Ä\n0160 8E C6 FC F3 A5 1F 61 FF - 26 5A 7C BE 93 7D EB 03  é∆¸Û•aˇ \u0026Z|æì}Î.\n0170 BE 99 7D E8 33 00 BE 9C - 7D E8 2D 00 CD 18 EB FE  æô}Ë3.æú }Ë-.ÕÎ˛\n0180 02 17 D9 89 87 4C 74 48 - B9 89 4F BE 99 95 F3 4D  .ŸâáLtH πâOæôïÛM\n0190 47 52 00 47 65 00 48 44 - 00 52 64 00 20 45 72 0D  GR.Ge.HD .Rd.

      "content": "I made this post in the Ventoy forums.\n\nI\u0027ve been trying to get my Acer uefi-only laptop to boot from a Ventoy usb with no luck (although it did work at first). Frustratingly I only get the \"Linpus lite\" boot option which does nothing and my Windows boot option. Strangely if I format a usb drive using Easy2Boot with agfm that drive will be recognized by the computer boot menu as USB HDD. If I delete all the files from the EFI partition of the E2B drive and replace them with Ventoy files it goes back to Linpus lite again. If I then delete all the Ventoy files and put back the E2B+agfm files, I still get Linpus lite again. Only doing a clean install of E2B+agfm will make it recognize the USB as bootable again. E2B sets first partition as boot and second partition with \"lba\" flag. Ventoy sets first partition as boot and second with \"esp\" flag. Changing partition flags has no effect though. The only way around this is to go to the bios and manually add the EFI file as trusted, but it\u0027s not a good solution. If I use a different USB with Ventoy I have to add the EFI files again even though they\u0027re exactly the same, and constantly switching usb sticks makes those permanent boot options not work half the time. Could be UEFI just sucks on this Acer laptop although it won\u0027t boot in Virtualbox either. Virtualbox just drops me to the uefi shell. I can manually boot the usb stick from their by navigating to the efi/boot folder and running the bootx64.efi file. Not sure why the bootx64.efi is refusing to be recognized/loaded by UEFI booting when USB sticks created with E2B or Rufus work fine. I was hoping to use the Kaspersky shim same as E2B to load Ventoy but usb can\u0027t be recognized as bootable either way.\n\nTested using 3 different usb sticks, 32gb sandisk ultra, 16gb sandisk cruze blade, 8gb kingston datatraveler.  \n\nI was hoping to use a Ventoy disk for troubleshooting support on different PCs, it\u0027s a much cleaner setup than E2B and no need for contigous files. I\u0027ll have to find another UEFI computer to test. Curious to know what Rufus and E2B do differently that makes the uefi bios load the bootx64.efi and properly present the usb as a USB HDD option. MBR booting works fine of course.\n\n**Edited by sabl, 09 June 2020 - 05:54 PM.**\n"

If I boot into Windows 10 and reboot in the Windows advanced restart menu, there is an option to reboot to \"EFI USB\". If I do that I get a bios prompt stating that there are no bootable usbs attached. Of course it\u0027ll work with E2B/Rufus usbs, basically anything that gets detected by the bios as a \"USB HDD\" boot option.\n\n**Edited by sabl, 09 June 2020 - 07:51 PM.**\n"

I am of course using the latest version of Ventoy, 1.0.13.\n\nThe only other differences I can see is that under bootice, the MBR for E2B says GRUB4DOS, and the PBR for 1st partition is GRUB4DOS, and 2nd partition is BOOTMGR boot record. For Ventoy, the MBR and PBR are \"Unknown\". Formatting the exFat partition to NTFS with windows changes the PBR to BOOTMGR boot record.

It has a KT4AV MS-6712, and the BIOS doesn\u0027t have UEFI features yet. It can also boot from the USB, but recognizes them as floppy disk (shown as USB RMD-FDD on boot selection).  \n\nWhen I select it, it seems that the BIOS will skip the USB drive and proceed to boot to the HDD, so it never goes to Ventoy.  \n\nHowever, when I boot it using Plop Boot Manager, it works! I can see the Ventoy menu!  \n\nBefore booting, I see that in my Windows 10 laptop, I can see that the installer has made two partitions. However, my old PC can only boot to USB as long as it\u0027s a single partition.  \n\nI prefer to use the BIOS to boot to USB, so what should I do so my BIOS can boot to Ventoy USB? By the way, the American Megatrends BIOS in my motherboard is released in 2001 and the motherboard itself is released in 2003.   \n"

Not looking for files, because many Linux distros can\u0027t mount exFAT/NTFS partition.\n\n2、As you said, disk signature was used by windows, I\u0027m not sure that whether the OS will overrite it or not. So I design this UUID from the first release of Ventoy. With this I can 100% confirm that it will work.\n\n3、As Q1, the UUID was passed to the OS and ventoy look for disk by the UUID in OS.\n\n"
