      "content": "Hi to all developers,\n\nwe, as many others, wondered why there is no SMART support on Windows 2003 Server with storport AHCI drivers like StorAhci. For us it was time to investigate into this topic lately. The results have been uploaded to Sourceforge with some example source code for demonstration. This should be a resource to every interested developer out there.\n\nToday we released two patched versions of the storport driver for Windows 2003. The first version patches the storport driver of the leaked Windows Server 2003 source code archive. The second version patches storport of Windows 7 and uses it in combination with ntoskrn7.sys, which is sort of a self compiled extender library for ntoskrnl.exe to add support for missing functions called by Windows 7 storport.\n\nTo download the files and the ReadMe go to [https://sourceforge....-support/files/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/storport-win2003-smart-support/files/ \"External link\")\n\nIf you are interested in the reversing process visit [https://storport-win...sourceforge.io/](https://storport-win2003-smart-support.sourceforge.io/ \"External link\")\n\nWe hope this will be a valuable resource to you all. Have fun!\n\nGreets Kai Schtrom\n\n"
