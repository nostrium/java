      "content": "I tried to create bootable usb using WinSetupFromUSB but i had to force close it because it stuck on defragmenting. After that the usb is not recognized by windows explorer, i am using Windows 10. Also, it is not recognized by WinSetupFromUSB or Easy2Boot.  \nThe strange thing is that diskpart recognizes the usb and i can successfully format and partition the drive with diskpart. Also, the usb drive is recognized by MiniTool Partition Wizard and i can format it successfully. But the usb drive is still not recognized by WinSetupFromUSB and Easy2Boot. Can this usb drive be repaired?\n\n"
