      "content": "I\u0027m typing this from my laptop, while booted in using an external hard drive. I wanted to make a fresh windows install on the external hard drive, and after trying a bunch of stuff that didn\u0027t work I eventually got it to be bootable by using MiniTool Partition Wizard to clone my entire laptop\u0027s drive (partitions, system files, personal files, everything) to the external hard drive. I thought I would be able to reset the windows installation on the hard drive from there, using the Reset this PC \\\u003e Remove Everything feature. But when I try that, it says: \"Your PC can\u0027t be reset because it\u0027s running Windows To Go\"... I want to reset the newly cloned installation on the external hard drive, not the one in my laptop. I can\u0027t find any information or tutorials on how to do this. Does someone know how (or have an idea for a better method)?  \n\n"
