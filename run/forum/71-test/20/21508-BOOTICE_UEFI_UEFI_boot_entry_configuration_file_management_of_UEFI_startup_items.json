It\u0027s looking we can manage multiple UEFI Bootloaders using BOOTICE -\\\u003e UEFI -\\\u003e UEFI Boot entry options. Had anybody tried it before ?\n\n![post-65263-0-10242500-1493427093.png](http://reboot.pro/uploads/monthly_04_2017/post-65263-0-10242500-1493427093.png)\n\nI think above UEFI options show only in UEFI Environment ?

The environment just prior to this is WinPE 10. BootICE works fine with manually re-ordering the boot options since there is a human that can recognize and select the needed boot object, but I was hoping that I could find out what the command line switches are that allow this to be scripted.\n\n"
