      "content": "Hi All  \n\nI feel as if I\u0027ve read just about every resource over the last few days regarding XP from USB installs and I now have a C: root full of various tools and a small pile of USB flash drives, SD cards and an external USB HDD to my name... and only just got the PC to start to play ball.  \n\nA little history and info:  \nI\u0027ve got an Acer Revo R3600 which came supplied with just a lite Linux quickboot OS.  \nFollowing various guides and using a range of software tools (created both from a Vista machine and an XPSP3 machine) I continually got NTLDR missing errors at which point I suspected the media I was using.  \nSo today I got a Kingston Datatraveller 4GB (I\u0027d read on a forum that someone had success with one of these) and tried again using RMPrepUSB and WinSetupFromUSB with the drive set as a harddisk using NTFS.  \n\nSo now I\u0027m getting somewhere:  \nI get to the second option screen and choose part 1. I get the windows blue screen with the grey bar at the bottom with F6 for RAID, etc then it loads kernell debugger, AHCI drivers etc, but then suddenly stops and restarts.  \nIt comes back to the second option screen where it has already highlighted Part2. When I select this I get the ever popular   \n\n```\nWindows could not start because the following file is missing or corrupt\u0026#58;\n\n\u003cwindows root\u003e\\system32\\hal.dll\n```\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nSo I go back to the start and try selecting each of the listed partitions in the list. Each of the disk 0 entries gives the hal.dll error.  \nEach of the disk 1 entries gives  \n\n```\nWindows could not start because of a disk hardware configuration problem, etc, etc\n```\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nI\u0027m now at a bit of a dead end (and somewhat ragged it must be said!)  \n\nCan anyone assist with the next bit?  \n\nOh yeah, I\u0027m using a slipstreamed XPSP2 image  \n\nMuch obliged ![:confused1:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/confused1.gif)   \n"

I get the windows blue screen with the grey bar at the bottom with F6 for RAID, etc then it loads kernell debugger, AHCI drivers etc, but then suddenly stops and restarts.  \nIt comes back to the second option screen where it has already highlighted Part2. When I select this I get the ever popular   \n\n```\nWindows could not start because the following file is missing or corrupt\u0026#58;\n\n\u003cwindows root\u003e\\system32\\hal.dll\n```\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nSo I go back to the start and try selecting each of the listed partitions in the list. Each of the disk 0 entries gives the hal.dll error.  \nEach of the disk 1 entries gives  \n\n```\nWindows could not start because of a disk hardware configuration problem, etc, etc\n```\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nI\u0027m now at a bit of a dead end (and somewhat ragged it must be said!)  \n\nCan anyone assist with the next bit?  \n\nOh yeah, I\u0027m using a slipstreamed XPSP2 image  \n\nMuch obliged ![:confused1:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/confused1.gif)   \n"
