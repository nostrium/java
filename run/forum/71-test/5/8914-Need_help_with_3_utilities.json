      "content": "You could integrate these into a single PE disk.  \n\nERD2005 is in essence a set of applications that runs in PE, and can be launched from PE. BartPE shows this. You could launch this from a batch file from PE, i suppose. If i recall correctly, it writes data to the c:\\\\ drive, so you may want to use a RAM disk for the data settings.  \n\nDAR i presume is a set of apps that are also added to PE. Enough is not known of this app to say what is needed here.  \n\nYou could have a single PE disk that has all of these apps on it, along with normal file utilities.   \n\nFor file management, ye need to configure your PE disk to use the local time zone, because this is what the target computers use.   \n"
