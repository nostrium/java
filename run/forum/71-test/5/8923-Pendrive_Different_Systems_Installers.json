I hope you guys can help me.  \n\nWell, the problem I have, is that I would like to create a bootable pendrive. Untill this point, everything is \"easy\", there are lots of tutorials. Okay. The next thing I want to do, is to have more than one OS to choose. I mean, that I would like to find out any tutorial or any How-to that explains me how can I create a boot menu, asking something like: What OS do you want to install? Then a list of for exemple XP, Vista, 7, so when I press any option, it automatically starts installing the OS selected.  \n\nI would like to clarify im not English speaker, so prolly I made a lots of mistakes. If you can\u0027t understand something from the text, ask me, and I will try to explain everything.   \n"
