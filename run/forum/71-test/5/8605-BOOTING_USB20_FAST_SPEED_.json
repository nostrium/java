      "content": "Hello everyone, here is my contribution, I have just build my new vista pe from 1.2RC1b CAPI project, the result is perfect , but the problem is fast usb 2.0 booting....  \nAfter searching the web and having tried all the method possible , kexec-loader , DOS bootdisk with usb2.0 drivers load GRUB etc... it seems it was impossible.  \n\nBUT I have found the solution!!!!  \nAnd it is simplier as you might think!  \nJust build your vistape with multiboot (grub enabled) and use the finalize script to create the USB booting files etc. ( I used FAT32 for the USB device )   \nJust download the latest PLop version 5.03 , it contains ageneric floppy boot image...  \nnow take this \"plpbt.img\" and copy it in the boot directory of the USB device.  \nSimply add this code to the menu.lst :   \n\ntitle Load USB2.0  \nfind --set-root /boot/plpbt.img  \nmap --mem /boot/plpbt.img (fd0)  \nmap --hook  \nchainloader (fd0)+1  \nrootnoverify (fd0)  \nmap --floppies\u003d1  \nboot  \n\nThat\u0027s all !!!!  \nSo what it does????  \nWith my gigabyte P35-DS4, wich supports usb booting, the speed is limited to USB1.1 althought the bios support 2.0, so :  \n- I but on the USB device and it put me to GRUB at 1.1 speed :-( ...  \n- Now I just launch the line Load USB2.0 from the GRUB Menu, it loads the PLop bootload,  \n- I just select to boot from USB in PLop,  \nI see Plop launching EHCI detection and GRUB is now appearing, I launch vistape logo in 10seconds now instead of three minutes!!!!!!  \nI launch Acronis mediarescue ISO in ram incredibily fast, and parted magic seem like it is installed over an HDD!!!  \n\nSo I can confirm it works!!!!  \nOn a second computer, wich support usb booting, but is equiped with a VIA southbridge 8237, the default usb booting speed is acceptable, but if I try the PLop trick mentioned above, the speed is really decreased....  \nSo what can we say?   \nI Think this is a EASY WORTH TRY, as if it works, the benefit is incredible ! and it is the only solution for the time being to do that only with ONE usb stick ( not one usb stick and a floppy disk with plop or a cd with plop, this is a all in one integrated solution!!!!!!!!  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nPlease make return here!  \nI \u0027am tryng to find a way of making UBCD4Win loading with it to see if it improves the loading speed too , but for the time being with my tests, seems it work for both linux (parted magic- acrons )and vistape.  \nThe advantage of this solution is that you just have to try booting vistape, with standard usb booting capabilities of th e motherboard. If it seems the progresss bar is rellay slow and you don\u0027t have time for a coffee, just reset computer, and give a try to the Plop trick, maybe you could boot in less than a minute!!!!  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nHere is the status of the bootloader for the upcoming version : things look promising!!!!!!!!  \n\n\"Tue 28/Jul/2009  \n\nUSB UHCI driver updated. Now its 2x faster. The driver update will be in the next release. You want to test the new driver? Then contact me.  \nSat 18/Jul/2009  \n\nplpgenbtldr v0.6 released. This version works now fine with NTFS and FAT partitions. Source code completely rewritten.\"  \n\nTo download PLop, go to its website at : [Plop Download Page](http://www.plop.at/en/bootmanagerdl.html \"External link\")   \n"

      "content": "Hello everyone, here is my contribution, I have just build my new vista pe from 1.2RC1b CAPI project, the result is perfect , but the problem is fast usb 2.0 booting....  \nAfter searching the web and having tried all the method possible , kexec-loader , DOS bootdisk with usb2.0 drivers load GRUB etc... it seems it was impossible.  \n\nBUT I have found the solution!!!!  \nAnd it is simplier as you might think!  \nJust build your vistape with multiboot (grub enabled) and use the finalize script to create the USB booting files etc. ( I used FAT32 for the USB device )   \nJust download the latest PLop version 5.03 , it contains ageneric floppy boot image...  \nnow take this \"plpbt.img\" and copy it in the boot directory of the USB device.  \nSimply add this code to the menu.lst :   \n\ntitle Load USB2.0  \nfind --set-root /boot/plpbt.img  \nmap --mem /boot/plpbt.img (fd0)  \nmap --hook  \nchainloader (fd0)+1  \nrootnoverify (fd0)  \nmap --floppies\u003d1  \nboot  \n\nThat\u0027s all !!!!  \nSo what it does????  \nWith my gigabyte P35-DS4, wich supports usb booting, the speed is limited to USB1.1 althought the bios support 2.0, so :  \n- I but on the USB device and it put me to GRUB at 1.1 speed :-( ...  \n- Now I just launch the line Load USB2.0 from the GRUB Menu, it loads the PLop bootload,  \n- I just select to boot from USB in PLop,  \nI see Plop launching EHCI detection and GRUB is now appearing, I launch vistape logo in 10seconds now instead of three minutes!!!!!!  \nI launch Acronis mediarescue ISO in ram incredibily fast, and parted magic seem like it is installed over an HDD!!!  \n\nSo I can confirm it works!!!!  \nOn a second computer, wich support usb booting, but is equiped with a VIA southbridge 8237, the default usb booting speed is acceptable, but if I try the PLop trick mentioned above, the speed is really decreased....  \nSo what can we say?   \nI Think this is a EASY WORTH TRY, as if it works, the benefit is incredible ! and it is the only solution for the time being to do that only with ONE usb stick ( not one usb stick and a floppy disk with plop or a cd with plop, this is a all in one integrated solution!!!!!!!!  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nPlease make return here!  \nI \u0027am tryng to find a way of making UBCD4Win loading with it to see if it improves the loading speed too , but for the time being with my tests, seems it work for both linux (parted magic- acrons )and vistape.  \nThe advantage of this solution is that you just have to try booting vistape, with standard usb booting capabilities of th e motherboard. If it seems the progresss bar is rellay slow and you don\u0027t have time for a coffee, just reset computer, and give a try to the Plop trick, maybe you could boot in less than a minute!!!!  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nHere is the status of the bootloader for the upcoming version : things look promising!!!!!!!!  \n\n\"Tue 28/Jul/2009  \n\nUSB UHCI driver updated. Now its 2x faster. The driver update will be in the next release. You want to test the new driver? Then contact me.  \nSat 18/Jul/2009  \n\nplpgenbtldr v0.6 released. This version works now fine with NTFS and FAT partitions. Source code completely rewritten.\"  \n\nTo download PLop, go to its website at : [Plop Download Page](http://www.plop.at/en/bootmanagerdl.html \"External link\")   \n"

I have tried every way to try and load the PLOP boot manager ISO,IMA,BIN, ver5.0.3, test version and have been successful in getting to PlOP every time but it hangs when selecting USB from the PLOP menu. I see PlOP windows appear that says something like PORT 1 NO MASS USB DEVICE then it tries to boot and I get  \nF1 try reboot , F2 to run setup screen. I have tried to config plpbt.bin with int19h\u003don, int19h\u003doff everything I can think of. any help would be appreciated.   \n"

Also, Grub4Dos freezes at the menu when booted from USB stick and I have to press my power button quickly twice to unfreeze it.  \n\nI\u0027ll post my results on the official PLOP forum as well.   \n"
