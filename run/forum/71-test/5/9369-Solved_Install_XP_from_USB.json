      "content": "Please Please help me... I followed your steps (which seemed really hard) and got to the boot to the Dell Mini 9 part and it said couldn\u0027t find hal.dll, so i took the usb key and fixed the boot.ini with the code you posted too and that worked to go install windows...  \n\nBut now when i try to boot the dell mini 9 to finish the installation process when it restarted, it says the same thing again but for the computer, How can i get into the computer and change that boot.ini?  \n\nPlease help me i need to have this computer running soon to take with me on my trip back home and have it working. Anyone can help me figure this out? Thanks!   \n"

      "content": "Ok i think i got things further, im actually posting this from my dell mini 9 but everytime i boot i need to boot using the last option on the usb stick because it wont boot otherwise. I noticed that its probably because my boot.ini is showing its trying to boot from c: which is the usbstick (i changed the usb stick drive to drive F) and my SSD hard drive is on drive D:, i tried to change that drive to C: but windows wont let me, can anyone help?  \n\nIf i try to boot up alone, it just says that the hardware doesn\u0027t match or something similar. Anyone?   \n"
