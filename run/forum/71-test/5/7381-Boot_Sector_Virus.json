Since NT does not have control of  \n\u003e the computer during system boot-up, booting from an infected floppy diskette allows the virus to infect the MBR of  \n\u003e any of the physical drives on the system using the usual techniques. This vector of infection is quite common, and  \n\u003e we can expect to see more of the same.  \n\u003e\n\u003e **MBR Infection by Running a Dropper Program or Multipartite Virus**   \n\u003e Dropper programs and multipartite viruses infect the MBR of the hard drive by using BIOS or DOS services to write  \n\u003e directly to the hard drive. Since Windows NT prevents all such writes from within Windows NT DOS box, this type  \n\u003e of infection will be completely prevented while NT is running. However, if the computer in question also has the  \n\u003e ability to boot to DOS or Windows 95, then the user could boot to one of these operating systems and execute the  \n\u003e dropper program or multipartite virus normally.\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nFirst case is EXACTLY what a USB stick can cause (if you boot from it).  \nSecond case states (correctly) that you cannot anymore write to MBR using BIOS or DOS services, .... but you can use Windows NT ones allright....![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif)  \n\nOperating systems evolve, virii do the same...![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif)  \n\njaclaz   \n"
