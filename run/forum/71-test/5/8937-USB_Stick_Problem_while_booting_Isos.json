      "content": "Hi guys.  \n\nThe idea I have over my head, is to create a booteable pendrive, with some kind of menu to be able to choose what to do. For exemple a list with few Operative Systems to install so when you enter into any option, it automatically starts to boot the instalation or the program selected.  \n\nThe problem I actually have, is that I \"could\" do that with Grub. I have Grub4dos installed into my pendrive. Its booteable and working perfectly, but I\u0027ve been looking a lot of threads on this forum and I noticed that there are a lot of problems if you try to boot a .iso file from grub4dos.  \n\nSo now, I\u0027m looking for another way to create this kind of menu and to successfuly start the instalation of a OS selected on that menu without any kind of problem.   \n\nGot any ideas?   \n"
