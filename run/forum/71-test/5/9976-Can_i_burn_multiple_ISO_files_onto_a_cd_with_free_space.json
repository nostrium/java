      "content": "No, you cannot.  \n\nDepending on the type of file it may be possible to do some hacking.  \n\nBut not in a \"general\" way, we need to understand the exact type of the files involved and the reason for this and for the \"not an option\" you listed.  \n\nTheory may be hacking the multisession approach, i.e. instead of importing the previous session as is, import it and modify it before writing it.  \nBut to do this (if possible) on the fly a \"special\" program needs to be written, or you again will need a \"local\" writable copy/image somewhere.  \n\nSomething seemingly unrelated (but not much ![:thumbup:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/thumbup.gif)) could be these new half-iso compatible approaches (if the files are compressible):  \n[http://www.pismotechnic.com/](http://www.pismotechnic.com/ \"External link\")  \n[http://www.pismotechnic.com/ptiso/](http://www.pismotechnic.com/ptiso/ \"External link\")  \n[http://www.pismotechnic.com/ciso/](http://www.pismotechnic.com/ciso/ \"External link\")  \n[http://www.pismotechnic.com/cfs/](http://www.pismotechnic.com/cfs/ \"External link\")   \n\n![:rolleyes:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/rolleyes.gif)  \n\njaclaz   \n"

      "content": "thank u jaclaz  \nlet me explain my purpose for wanting to do this.I need to backup encrypted copies of sensitive files from my HDD to a DVD.And i need to make backups very frequently.Further i want to be able to view encrypted files on my DVD by decrypting them on the fly(ie i dont want to pull data out of the dvd,decrypt it on HDD etc).To achieve this i can create a truecrypt [www.truecrypt.org](http://www.truecrypt.org \"External link\") container of 4.5 gigs;keep on adding data to it frequently and then finally burn it to a dvd after a 3-4 weeks.  \nDisadvantage of doing this is that i wont be able to do the backups every day(i\u0027ll\u0027ve to wait for 3-4 weeks)  \nSo if i can get a software which can write a part of file(any file eg:a notepad file,mp3 file,truecrypt container-which is also a file etc) onto a dvd,i can presumably burn parts of truecrypt-file-container and finally achieve the full encrypted container on the DVD.Of course many file formats,if burned to the DVD in this manner(assuming burning in this manner is possible) wont be readable from the dvd until a part of it is missing(no matter how small that missing part is.An mp3 file might need even its last byte of data to be read off the dvd.).But i\u0027ve found this problem does not occur with truecrypt container files which is why i am tring to find such a software  \nIn fact burning in such a manner will render the dvd unreadable,irrespective of whether the file i am working on requires its last few bits to be read off the dvd,because the burning process was not finalised and the cd was not \"ready\"  \nTo help you visualise,imagine you are working with a notepad file.You use some kind of software to split the \".txt\" file to 2 files viz \".part1txt\" and \".part2txt\" and saving the \".part1txt\" file onto the dvd via the special burning process(again,assuming burning in this manner is possible).The next time i pop on the dvd into the drive i get a message saying \"windows is unable to process the disk\" or something to that effect(the dvd was not finallised.Its in \"limbo state\").Then i fire up the software the next day to burn the \".part2txt\" file to the dvd.When this \"special burning process\" is complete,i am able to view the complete notepad file on the dvd!   \n"

      "content": "Data in Truecrypt container file are pseudorandomly place all over the container, not sequentially.   \nYou cannot select small used part of it easily. Forget about writing small part of it.   \nIf partial backup DVD cannot be read until it is complete. What is the point of making it.   \n\nOne possible simple way to backup data incrementally.  \n\n* Create large container file or device (A) to be used in hard disk.\n* When you want to backup, create new small container file (B1) that is slightly larger than the data you want to backup.   \n  Copy data to container file B1.   \n  Unmount B1. Write container file B1 to multisession DVD.\n* When you want to backup again, create new small container file (B2) that fit new data you want to backup.   \n  Copy new data to new container file B2.   \n  Unmount B2. Add container file B2 to multisession DVD.\n* When you want to backup again, create new small container file (B3) that fit new data you want to backup.   \n  Copy new data to new container file B3.   \n  Unmount B3. Add container file B3 to multisession DVD.\n\nThis way you latest backup data is always available.   \nBut the data is separeated in many small container files.   \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nAnother more complex setup.  \n\n* Create large container file or device (A) to be used in hard disk.\n* When you want to backup, create a 4.5GB dynamically-allocated virtual hard disk (VHD1) in A.  \n  Add data to VHD1. Detach VHD1.  \n  Create small container file file (B1) that is slightly larger than size of VHD1.   \n  Move VHD1 into B1.   \n  Unmount B1. Write container file B1 to multisession DVD.\n* If you want read data from backup, mount B1.  \n  Attach VHD1. Read data from it.   \n  Detach VHD when you finished reading data.\n* When you want to backup again, put the DVD in the drive. Mount B1.   \n  Create a differencing virtual hard disk (VHD2) in A, use VHD1 in B1 as parent.   \n  Add data to VHD2. Detach VHD2.  \n  Create small container file file (B2) that is slightly larger than size of VHD2.   \n  Move VHD2 into B2.   \n  Unmount B2. Add container file B2 to multisession DVD.\n* If you want read data from backup, mount B1, B2 (all of them).  \n  Attach VHD2. Read data from it.   \n  Detach VHD when you finished reading data.\n* When you want to backup again, put the DVD in the drive. Mount B1, B2 (all of them).  \n  Create a differencing virtual hard disk (VHD3) in A, use VHD2 in B2 as parent.   \n  Add data to VHD3. Detach VHD3.  \n  Create small container file file (B3) that is slightly larger than size of VHD3.   \n  Move VHD3 into B3.  \n  Unmount B3. Add container file B3 to multisession DVD.\n* If you want read data from backup, mount B1, B2, B3 (all of them).  \n  Attach VHD3. Read data from it.   \n  Detach VHD when you finished reading data.\n* When you want to backup again, put the DVD in the drive. Mount B1, B2, B3 (all of them).  \n  Create a differencing virtual hard disk (VHD4) in A, use VHD3 in B3 as parent.   \n  Add data to VHD4. Detach VHD4.  \n  Create small container file file (B4) that is slightly larger than size of VHD4.   \n  Move VHD4 into B4.   \n  Unmount B4. Add container file B4 to multisession DVD.\n* If you want read data from backup, mount B1, B2, B3, B4 (all of them).  \n  Attach VHD4. Read data from it.   \n  Detach VHD when you finished reading data.\n\nIn this case data is also in many small container files.   \nWhen you mount all of them and attach latest VHD, all data will appear to be in one virtual volume.   \n"

      "content": "thank you very much karyonix,  \ni got the basic idea  \n1)i fill up the dvd with truecrypt containers as a result of frequent backups  \n2)each of those containers will contain a \"VHD\" which will be the child of another \"VHD\" in another container.So i mount all truecrypt containers,then \"attach\" the latest/last created \"VHD\"(which is actually the \"differencing VHD\" whose parent is the 2nd last \"VHD\") in order to read data.And when i am done with reading data,i \"detach\" the \"VHD\" which i had created in the very beginning and subsequently dismount all truecrypt containers  \nBut unfortunately i dont understand the terms i enclosed within double inverted commas.I dont know how to create VHDs and differencing VHDs.If this topic is too vast to be discussed here,please point me to some other resource which can help me like some site which specialises in virtulisation.   \n"

      "content": "thank you karyonix,  \ni could do what i wanted.I used the VHD method you suggested and it worked very well.Not only did it help me with encryption,i could also learn a lot of new stuff  \nWhile searching the net i found that there was a software for this purpose way back in the 90sfor windows 98!The link is:[encryptcd v 1.2.1](http://www.security-forums.com/viewtopic.php?t\u003d9994\u0026sid\u003de12e4c373296b08a334ece1a0429f9a4 \"External link\")  \ni googled for it a lot but could not find it.So if there is any chance that anyone who reads this post happens to have that software(i understand that it was last seen on the web 10 years ago and that the odds are against me.But i am still hopeful),please upload it here  \nI also found out that [FREEcompusec 5.2](http://www.ce-infosys.com/english/downloads/free_compusec/index.html \"External link\") includes a module viz CDcrypt.Has anyone used it?(i could have tried using it but it would require me to encrypt my entire HDD just because i need a very small module-CDcrypt.)  \nPlease note that theres another software which goes by almost the same name(cryptCD 5.1) which also encrypts cds/dvds but is commercial(trial available at wareseeker.com.And i dont think i can buy it even if i am ready to pay for it because the homepage is no longer available)   \n"
