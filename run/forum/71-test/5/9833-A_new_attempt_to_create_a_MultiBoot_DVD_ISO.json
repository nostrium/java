      "content": "After my XP has suddenly passed and I barely was able to revive and reinstall I would like to continue working on my old Emergency Multiboot DVD / USB again.  \n\nMedium: 4 GB DVD / ISO  \n\nContents:   \n1 NotfallXP PE  \n2. Emergency Win7 PE  \n3. Utilitie CD Erdcommander 2005  \n__________  \n4. Linux (Puppy, Muppy or similar)  \n__________  \n5. Original XP ISO  \n6. Win7 Original ISO  \n__________  \n7. Reboot  \n\nIs it technically feasible to create such a DVD / ISO.  \nWhat lends itself to best: Gru4dos, Syslinux, ....  \nThe whole CD\u0027s I have as ISO\u0027s.  \nMy last project I tried involved with grub4dos was awarded as allerdimgs not Linux.  \n\nIt would be nice if I can help somebody something.  \n\nThanks Klaus  \n\nPS: Please do not be sore about my English (Google translator)   \n"
