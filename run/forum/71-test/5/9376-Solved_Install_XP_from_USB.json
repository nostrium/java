      "content": "Thanks for USB_Multiboot_10. It worked when every other method of installing XP that I\u0027d tried (including from CD!) had failed.  \n\nI was wondering if there\u0027s any way to start the install from Grub4Dos, either directly or by loading NTLDR/boot.ini. I just personally would prefer my USB stick to boot into Grub rather than boot.ini as most of the time I boot from my stick it\u0027s because I want to use one of the tools on it rather than install XP, which I would only do occasionally.  \n\nI\u0027ve tried using \"chainloader /ntldr\" from Grub which gets the boot.ini menu up, but from there I just get an error such as \"Missing helper\", no doubt for good reason which someone will kindly explain to me ![:whistling:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/happy22.gif)   \n"

Obviously that way requires a working XP environment already on the HD, but as I always set up my PC\u0027s with dual (or more) boot, that wouldn\u0027t be a problem most of the time. Then again, it looks like I could skip Boot_IMG.exe and just use USB_XP_Setup.exe with dual boot. (Incidentally, why does Boot_IMG.exe need me to point it to the XP Setup Source Folder?)  \n\nI\u0027ll still need to be able to install from DOS/boot from USB when building a new PC or on someone else\u0027s PC where the only XP is no longer bootable, but those occasions are likely to be rare.   \n"
