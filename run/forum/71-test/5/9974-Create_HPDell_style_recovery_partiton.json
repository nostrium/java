The reason i want this is to place vistape on the second drive along with acronis and a image of my hard disk so i can easily restore computers. I know it isnt smart to keep backups on same drive but that isnt a issue. i need to restore alot of computers quickly without attaching external drives or via LAN. BTW some of these pcs ARE infact compaq/HP but others are generic or toshiba..etc   \n"
