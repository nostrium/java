      "content": "I have many different USB2 boxes (enclosures) to host different 2\"5 IDE hard disks.  \nFor normal usage of storing data, no explicit problems found, they are all recognized (plug-and-play) and have a drive letter under XP/Vista.  \nBut for BIOS boot point of view, there is a difference I found with one box. This box (regardless of what kind of HDD put inside) is seen in   \none BIOS (Phoenix) as removable, instead of USB HDD (note: my USB keys are always seen as USB HDD, which is good).  \nBeing seen as removable, of course this HDD cannot be booted (MBR presence, while BIOS did not expect this).  \nCuriously this HDD could be partitioned without any problem or error message under hard disk manager of XP.  \nPartition magic 8 however issued error message about invalid partition table (which was for me at this time incoherent since XP hard disk manager  \ndid not have any problem handling this disk, and I can do any read/write to the disk).  \n\nThis problem caused lot of investigation hours because I thinked the HDD was faulty, while in fact it is only the problem of the USB enclosure and BIOS.   \n"

      "content": "Yes, it depends on the USB controller inside the case, or to be more accurate, on the settings the manufacturer chose.  \n\nThe situation should be exactly the same as that of USB sticks, see here:  \n[http://www.911cd.net...showtopic\u003d15776](http://www.911cd.net/forums//index.php?showtopic\u003d15776 \"External link\")  \n\nThough this is VERY strange:  \n\u003e Curiously this HDD could be partitioned without any problem or error message under hard disk manager of XP.\n\nWith a bit of luck, knowing exact make/model of controller and USB ID, you may be able to find the manufacturer utility or \"Mass Production Tool\" in order to \"flip\" the removable bit.  \n\njaclaz   \n"

      "content": "In my experience different BIOs like different USB controllers (in the storage device)  \n\nSo, your Bobotronik motherboard might not like your Squeezgurp USB flash stick. It\u0027s really a process of trial and error (unfortunately.)  \n\nI\u0027ve had the best luck with USB storage devices that use real hard drives.   \n"
