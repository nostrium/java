      "content": "Easyboot, besides being COMMERCIAL software :tongue: , is a tool related to building ONLY boot CD\u0027s and DVD\u0027s, **NOT** HD, USB sticks or USB hard disks.  \n\nThere are a fair number of tools, both Commercial and Open Source that fall into the category of \"bootmanagers\" that ONLY work on FD or HD like devices.  \n\nOf these, among the Freeware ones I can mention partita:  \n[http://www.pedrofrei...om/crea1_en.htm](http://www.pedrofreire.com/crea1_en.htm \"External link\")  \nand mrbldr:  \n[http://www.boot-land...mbldr-t334.html](http://www.boot-land.net/forums/OS-BS-ride...mbldr-t334.html \"External link\")  \nthe distinctive advantage of these two is that they both fit completely in the MBR (512 bytes), so they are theoretically compatible with ALL partition managing software, unlike some other ones that occupy some of the \"hidden\" sectors of first track.  \n\nOn the contrary Grub4DOS, GPL, is a tool specific to HD\u0027s and similar devices that can ALSO be used on bootable CD\u0027s.  \n\nThe good thing about Grub4dos is the fact that it can be run fro either DOS (grub.exe) or from BOOT.INI (grldr) through NTLDR, so that you won\u0027t need to even touch the MBR.  \n\nThe syntax is more \"logical\" than most other bootmanagers and the same menu.lst can be used on floppy, CD or HD type of devices, and it is of course fully compatible with any kind of Linux.  \n\njaclaz   \n"
