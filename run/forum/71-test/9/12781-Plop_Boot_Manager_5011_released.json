      "content": "hi,   \ni released the plop boot manager 5.0.11 ![:dubbio:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/dubbio.gif)   \n\nhere is the list of the changes from 5.0.10 to 5.0.11  \n\n**Updates from 5.0.10 to 5.0.11:**   \nCPU usage heavily reduced.  \nGraphic card init bug fixed.  \nhimem.sys bug fixed - himem.sys was unable to enable gate A20 on some machines after the boot manager was running.  \nUpdate of the number of hard disk drives in the bios data area for booting usb reactivated.  \nLoading the network option rom from the main menu (+ new hotkey) to continue to boot from network.  \nLinux Kernel Command Line support for plpbt.bin - dynamic configuration with parameters.  \nFAT12/16 boot sector update - important to boot dos from 2nd, 3rd,... hard disk.  \nPCMCIA CardBus support for USB PC-Cards.  \nUSB drivers updated.  \nPartition setup text \u0027VIEW/EDIT/COPY data\u0027 changed to \u0027Edit MBR/Import data\u0027.  \nISO files in floppy emulation mode are removed from the zip file.  \nPCI Bus scan updated (needed for PCMCIA).  \nExtention drive parameter scan for USB drives added and recalculating the number of hard disks. This should fix some troubles on PC\u0027s with grub and BIOS USB.  \nUSB drivers updated to report the extention drive parameter v3.0.  \nMain menu hotkey 1-9 was not working for the last visible profile, its fixed now.   \n\n**plpcfgbt updates:**   \nHelp page layout changed.  \nNow, the program reports a warning when plpbt.bin has an old config structure - before plpcfgbt 0.9 the program reported an error because of the config structure and stopped the plpbt.bin configuration.  \nNew parameters are hiddenusb, hiddencdrom, skippcmcia, fastpcmcia.   \n\nThe graphical frontend plpcfgbtGUI 0.1-test for plpcfgbt.exe released.  \n\n**plpgenbtldr updates:**   \nxo output removed.  \nplpbtldr.bin writes an error info text when there was problem with loading plpbt.bin.   \n\n**plpchk.exe:**   \nplpchk.exe is a new dos tool to detect plop usb driver from config.sys, from a batch file or from the command line. The program can create/remove a file that can be checked for existence and it returns the errorlevel code for batch files. You can run it in a hidden mode without any screen output.   \n\n**plpdisd.exe:**   \nUpdated to disable the usb driver used in 5.0.11   \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n**Plans/ideas for next releases:**   \nATA (CF) PC-Card support.  \nFinish USB CDROM support.  \nSupport USB 3.0.  \nSupport PXE Splitted ROM\u0027s.  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n[http://www.plop.at/e...mngrusblog.html](http://www.plop.at/en/bootmngrusblog.html \"External link\")  \n\nbest regards  \nelmar   \n"

      "content": "Hi Elmar,  \n\nThanks for the update and your great program! I\u0027m new to Plop. Could you explain here and also add to your Readme file, how to uninstall Plop? In your Readme you describe various Harddisk installation scenarios and mention, how each affects uninstall, mention Complete and Short Uninstall, but yet say nothing on how exactly to unistall your program, and appear to not provide uninstall utility either. Why is that? I installed it to HD from DOS. It didn\u0027t create plpback.bin as far as I can see - why is that?  \n\nMy questions are:  \n\n- how exactly to uninstall Plop? Why you don\u0027t provide this info and routing for users?  \n- why complete unistall is only possible from Floppy? Why not write plpback.bin when installing from DOS or Win Boot Menu?  \n- did you also update plpgenbtldr-0.7.zip for this release?  \n- My Plop install has only one USB Boot menu option. How to select a USB device to boot from, if several are connected to the PC? Ctrl option is not convenient compare to USB device list in Boot Menu.  \n- Why Plop Boot Menu isn\u0027t intuitive and device descriptive enough to find the right boot device easily?  \n- Why Boot from CD menu option doesn\u0027t result in booting from internal CD-Rom Drive (with Windows install \\\u0026 repair CD as an example)?  \n- can you add Boot from ISO option to Plop Boot Menu? Its long overdue given current ISO usage trends.   \n\n**Edited by sambul61, 20 October 2010 - 12:58 PM.**\n"

      "content": "\u003e ....and do not provide uninstall utility either. Why is that?\nbecause the install program is also the uninstall program. why do you need 2 programs when one program can do both things?  \n\n\u003e I installed it to HD from DOS. It didn\u0027t create plpback.bin as far as I can see.\nthen i think you used \"plpinstc.com\" and not \"plpinst.com\".   \nplpback.bin will be created only when you use plpinst.com. the C in plpinstc.com stands for CDROM and as you know, cdrom\u0027s are not writeable and so this installer version does not create the backup file plpback.bin. but this is written in the warning text when you start plpinstc.com. plpinstc.com is additionally always used when writing to a drive is not possible, like running from another boot managers and so on....  \n\n\u003e - how exactly to uninstall Plop? Why did you hide this info and routing from users?\nhey, i do not hide this info. but i assume, when somebody is fit enough to use a boot manager then he can understand the option \"UNINSTALL\" in the installer program. the uninstall option is the opposite of the install option. simply choose it and the boot manager will be removed. is this really so difficult???  \n\nhowever, when you press ctrl-f on the boot manager site and you search for \"uninstall\", then you will find there infos too.  \n\n\u003e - why complete unistall is only possible from Floppy? Why not write plpback.bin when installing from DOS or Win Boot Menu?\nuninstall is possible from dos!  \nwhy only floppy? because a floppy is writeable and an external storage and not affected when something bad happened with the hard disk.   \nthe install program supports only FAT. when the install program is started from floppy, then there is a fat and the installer can write the plpback.bin (backup of modified sectors) to the floppy.   \nwhen the install program is started from the windows boot menu, then there is no connection to any partition to write the backup file. to provide the writing of the backupfile from the windows boot menu i had to add ntfs and partition mounting routines to the installer. thats a lot of work. when people don\u0027t want to install the boot manager to the hard disk, then there is still the option to run the boot manager from the windows boot menu without installing it to the mbr.  \n\nhowever, the complete uninstall with plpback.bin was made if something really bad happened when the boot manager was installed. normally its enough to write a new mbr when you dont want to have the boot manager any more. and this option is also available in the install program.  \n\n\u003e - did you aslo update plpgenbtldr-0.7.zip for this release?\nyes, but only minor changes  \n\n\u003e - My Plop install has only one USB Boot menu option. How to select a USB device to boot from, if several are connected to the PC? Ctrl option is not convenient compare to device list in Boot Menu.\nbecause the usb drivers are loaded on demand. one device after another is detected when you use the usb option. i have less then 32kb available to put all the boot manager to the place before the first partition starts. so i think the solution with the ctrl key is more that you can expect from such a small and feature rich program.  \n\n\u003e - Why Boot from CD menu option doesn\u0027t result in booting from internal CD-Rom Drive (with Windows install \\\u0026 repair CD as an example)?\nthe cd boot option in the menu is only for ide cdrom drives and you can boot any cd\u0027s/dvd\u0027s. i think you have a sata cd drive and sata cd drives are not supported (see FAQ).   \n\n\u003e - can you add Boot from ISO option to Plop Boot Menu? Its long overdue given current ISO usage trends.\nno  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nregards  \nelmar   \n"

      "content": "i forgot to answer the question \"- Why Plop Boot Menu isn\u0027t intuitive and device descriptive enough to find the right boot device easily?\"  \n\n1) the lack of no exceeding description is the space that is available for the boot manager (see previous post), but what do you expect? a device manager that gives you detailed infos in the same way like the windows device manager? however, you should know to which partition you installed your system.  \n\n2) \"intuitive\" depends on the knowledge of the user. i got much respond that my boot manager is intuitive and easy to use. however, booting is a complex topic and overall its an essential part of your pc. i never said you should use it. its like changing your door lock by yourself. do it wrong -\\\u003e you can\u0027t enter, do it right -\\\u003e everything is fine. its your choice to do it.  \n\ni try to make everything as easy as possible for users, but to which level of knowledge should i go? how to start a pc? ![:dubbio:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/dubbio.gif)   \n\nbest regards  \nelmar   \n\n**Edited by BiTByte, 20 October 2010 - 08:42 PM.**\n"

      "content": "Thanks Elmar for the detail clarification!  \n\nSurprisingly, I can figure out how to start a PC. Do enjoy your program as well, wasn\u0027t well aware of tight space limits. Still, when I see Hard Drive 01 and Hard Drive 03 (or similar) in Plop Menu, I keep guessing, by what rule it lists the drives. It would help to ID them exactly as they ID\u0027d in BIOS, since that\u0027s where Plop gets IDs from.  \n\nAnother thing \"I should know\" is partition count. Anywhere I looked, can\u0027t find a partition (sequential) number. In Disk Management they\u0027re listed left to right, starting from 0 or 1? In Device Manager - Disk Drives - Volumes, they\u0027re listed top down from right to left. Again go figure which one is 0 or 1 after all. Also, if a Linux partition is between Windows partitions, should it be counted at all, when booting with Plop?  \n\nMore broadly, should a Linux partition be counted, when booting by any means, including Grub4dos, to Windows or ISO file located on Windows partition?  \n\nThe only thing, you didn\u0027t explain - why Plop can\u0027t boot ISO images? I guess, its also due to space limitation - easy to guess. ![:dubbio:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/dubbio.gif) I do have a SATA CD-ROM though - that explains why it didn\u0027t boot. It looks from your answer, if one will type Help in Command Prompt after Plop installer\u0027s file name, all options get listed, including Uninstall - users should figure that out.  \n\nThanks again for your very helpful program! I found it just recently, but can\u0027t imaging how to boot from USB in VMs without it. Given small size, this popular beauty is a piece of programming art.   \n\n**Edited by sambul61, 21 October 2010 - 03:20 AM.**\n"

It would help to ID them exactly as they ID\u0027d in BIOS, since that\u0027s where Plop gets IDs from.\nthe boot manager checks the existence of 4 hard disks. 80h to 83h, those are the bios numbers. no labels or anything else. when you see hda then its the drive 80h and this is the first hard disk that the bios provides. the bios does not provide hard disk names. ok, they display them in list, but they do a direct hardware access and reading this info from the device. i would be able to do the same (like i do for ide cdrom drives + showing the device name when the driver was loaded), but this would mean that i have to write many sata drivers to access the hardware. a bios is specialized to a motherboard, so it needs only one sata driver. the boot manager must run on different hardware, so it became a never ending story of writing drivers. dont forget, the boot manager is no operating system.  \n\n\u003e Another thing \"I should know\" is partition count. Anywhere I looked, can\u0027t find a partition (sequential) number. In Disk Management they\u0027re listed left to right, starting from 0 or 1? In Device Manager - Disk Drives - Volumes, they\u0027re listed top down from right to left. Again go figure which one is 0 or 1 after all. Also, if a Linux partition is between Windows partitions, should it be counted at all, when booting with Plop?\nit seems, you know only graphical interfaces. when you use text mode programs like fdisk or any clone of it, then you always get a list from top to bottom. hey, its only a way to display a table with data. and it should not to be so difficult to realize that \"hda partition 1\" is the first partition of the first hard disk, or?  \n\n\u003e More broadly, should a Linux partition be counted, when booting by any means, including Grub4dos, to Windows or ISO file located on Windows partition?\ni dont understand what you mean.  \n\n\u003e The only thing, you didn\u0027t explain - why Plop can\u0027t boot ISO images? I guess, its also due to space limitation - easy to guess. ![:hi:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/hi.gif)\n1) because the iso file is stored on a file system. to access the iso, i have to write drivers for file systems ntfs, ext2/3/4 and many more.  \n\n2) a new driver is required to provide the iso-\\\u003ecdrom emulation. that means, the boot manager will be bigger and there is no space left.  \n\n\u003e if one will type Help in Command Prompt after Plop installer\u0027s file name, all options get listed, including Uninstall - users should figure that out.\ni dont think that many people are using the installation from dos. however, the readme.txt is available and the website too. they can get their infos from there.  \n\n\u003e To clarify about Plop Boot Menu listings:  \n\u003e\n\u003e HDC Partition1  \n\u003e HDC Partition2  \n\u003e HDC Partition3  \n\u003e HDC Partition4  \n\u003e HDD Partition1  \n\u003e HDD Partition2  \n\u003e HDD Partition3  \n\u003e\n\u003e See, drive letters are assigned to each drive partitions differently depending on what partition you booted from this time. So a user would need to translate Plop drive list into current BIOS drive list. Why don\u0027t name drives exactly like they\u0027re named in BIOS - by make and model?\ndescribed above  \n\n\u003e Then a user would need to make convention with Plop on how to count partitions: from 0 or 1, from left or right (and which direction is towards drive axis). Some sources list drives from 0, but partitions from 1. Paragon lists partitions from 0. What about Plop? And are there any rules about it in Windows and Linux?\nsection boot manager / 3. setup / 3.1 partitions  \n[http://www.plop.at/e...tml#bootmanager](http://www.plop.at/en/bootmanager.html#bootmanager \"External link\")  \n\n\u003e Also, I guess its possible to list all bootable connected USB devices in the menu, but call each USB device driver only after it\u0027s selected in Plop. You know well, ppl seldom read Help, so guessing about Ctr+Enter and scrolling btw devices is not the best choice, especially given non-intuitive USB device listings. Calling them as they\u0027re called in BIOS would help.\nits no scrolling, its a detect device, display device, detect device, display device,... step by step. so a menu is not possible. why should i provide a menu, when people only want quickly to boot? i take me as example, the boot manager runs, i want to boot usb, i press \"u\" and usb boots. no long detection stuff like one bios of my pc\u0027s does (30 seconds to detect usb drives ![:dubbio:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/dubbio.gif) )  \n\n\u003e Finally, there should be a way to go back to Plop Boot Menu after making a wrong device choice instead of rebooting the system, similar to graceful retreat back in Grub4dos on Enter.\n\nas long as the boot manager did not execute the mbr/boot sector, a return to the boot manager menu is possible. the boot manager does some checks and warns you and you get the choice to continue or abort. but i can not do thousands checks. people must take care that their booting devices are able to boot.   \ngrub4dos also has only the possible fall back as long as the mbr/boot sector is not executed.   \n\nwhen the boot sector has been executed, then the operating system has the control. the boot manager does stay in the background and controlling what the operating system is doing that in a case of error the boot manager takes control and do something. a boot manager only initializes the boot of a system.   \n\nbest regards  \nelmar   \n"

      "content": "Thanks Elmar!  \n\nRegarding \"Toshiba not booting from Plop HD List\", I got the reason you posted (one must select that USB drive as 1-st in BIOS), but not completely. Following same logic, how Plop can possibly boot a 2-nd or 3-d IDE HD from its HD List, when 1-st IDE HD is selected in BIOS as boot disk? If Plop has a routing to bypass that BIOS setting (some call Plop a BIOS Extender), why don\u0027t apply in next Plop release the same routing to USB drives presented in Plop HD List?  \n\nRegarding \"Toshiba not booting from Plop USB List\", as I explained above, Plop is incorporated into EasyBCD Bootloader as its Boot Menu item. When Plop is selected in EasyBCD Boot Menu, Grub4dos bootloader, also incorporated into EasyBCD, boots Plop ISO. Once Plop ISO has booted and presents its Boot Menu list, I assume its no longer relevant, by what means it was booted. You select a USB drive in Plop and its supposed to boot it, but it hangs. I did not configure ISOLinux, which I pressume is part of Plop routing to boot USB drives. The immediately preceding Menu is Plop Boot Menu List, before that its just EasyBCD Boot Menu. Keep in mind, this setup works time-to-time with Sandisk Flash (i.e. Plop boots it when called from EasyBCD via NeoGrub), but never works with Toshiba USB (JMicron USB enclosure chipset). Hence, the cause seems to be not in how Plop started, but in its driver not working with JMicron chipset correctly.  \n\nThe reason I posted it, to give you a better idea what happen, and may be a better chance to fix it. Its NOT a critique of Plop, but only a constructive desire to improve its functionality and usability. The easy way for a developer to say may be that users are stupid. But at the end you write it for those stupid users I assume. If it doesn\u0027t work in a standard scenario of calling Plop from another Boot Manager (you say on your website, its a popular way to use Plop), it should be fixed. If there are flaws in its usability, as identified by users, they need to be addressed. That\u0027s how I see the whole point, but I was wrong before... :smile:   \n\n**Edited by sambul61, 25 October 2010 - 02:55 PM.**\n"

      "content": "Elmar,  \n\nEasyBCD installs Plop from its own .exe, its V5.0.x (didn\u0027t check, but you can see by file dates on my pic above). I just replaced it with V5.0.11 , and the result is similar. Here are my test results:  \n\nOn a real PC (regardless on how many USB devices are connected):  \n- Plop hangs on booting Toshiba USB to black screen without messages;  \n- Plop hangs on booting Sandisk Blade causing immediate PC reboot;  \n- Plop hangs on finding empty Y-Data Card Reader (it should offer to find next USB device).  \n\nOn a VMWare VM (all devices are represented as generic VMWare USB device):  \n- Plop boots Sandisk Cruiser, Toshiba USB, and offers to find next device after checking empty Y-Data Card Reader and finding no boot sector;  \n- [Plop always hangs on booting a second USB device regardless what device is it.](http://i52.tinypic.com/whfw45.jpg \"External link\") Yet it always boots the 1-st USB device after some initial training.  \n\nHence, no lack so far on booting any USB device I\u0027ve with Plop on a PC. Yet Plop V10 booted at times Sandisk Cruiser. What\u0027s interesting, initially Plop hangs several times on booting any USB device inside a VM, then it adapts somehow and starts booting the 1-st USB device every time. Given the fact its not a writable .iso, and the VM has no OS installed, how such stable adaptation is possible? Possibly the WinXP VM writes own logs about successful system boot, which Plop accesses next boot to refine its device boot params (I guess its too much for Plop to handle). :smile:   \n\n**Edited by sambul61, 26 October 2010 - 03:28 AM.**\n"

      "content": "Another issue that came up with Plop V11, when having several drives connected to a PC:  \n\n- when choosing from Plop Hard Drive Boot Menu any bootable partition of the 1-st boot drive selected in BIOS, it boots OK;  \n- when choosing a bootable partition from any other HD (not the 1-st one), Plop hangs with \"Invalid boot.ini file\" error message.  \n\nWell, of course, when connecting different drive combinations to the PC periodically, each of their partitions\u0027 boot.ini files points to 0 drive, as it may be the only drive used next time. Again, since Plop is called a BIOS Extender, its expected to perform just that role, meaning in this scenario that once you select a particular drive and partition from Plop HD Boot Menu, it will interpret its boot.ini such a way that allows to boot from that partition despite its not on the 1-st drive this time in BIOS settings. In other words, if the boot.ini says \"rdisk (0)\", Plop should interpret it as \"rdisk (n)\", where \"n\" is the position of the drive this time in BIOS drive lineup.  \n\nAnother suggestion along the same lines would be for Plop to search for boot.ini, when its missing on the volume, which is the case, when EasyBCD is installed on another volume of the same drive. Let say, EasyBCD is installed on a Win7 volume, and includes in its boot menu a WinXP volume on the same drive. In this case EasyBCD will delete boot.ini on WinXP volume and add ebcd.001 file in Win7 root. Plop can search, read and re-interpret ebcd.001 on Win7 volume instead of boot.ini on WinXP. What I mean, is a bit more intelligent treatment of found boot irregularities. ![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif) I hear your answer: \"limited file size\". But the point is, in a system with periodically changed drive combo Plop doesn\u0027t work as expected by a (stupid) user. For Plop to work, BIOS settings must be changed each time, thus making Plop redundant.  \n\nTrying to be objective, Grub4DOS, when installed separately on each HD, neither works properly in described scenario, unless bended dynamically via typing config entries at boot time. Say, I boot from 1-st drive, then select Grub4DOS in its boot menu, then select a second drive in Grub4DOS menu, then select Grub4DOS in the 2-nd drive menu once opened, and it fails to boot from an ISO file located on a volume on the 2-nd drive due to no intelligent volume remapping.   \n\n**Edited by sambul61, 29 October 2010 - 07:15 PM.**\n"

This should fix some troubles on PC\u0027s with grub and BIOS USB.  \nUSB drivers updated to report the extention drive parameter v3.0.  \nMain menu hotkey 1-9 was not working for the last visible profile, its fixed now.   \n\n**plpcfgbt updates:**   \nHelp page layout changed.  \nNow, the program reports a warning when plpbt.bin has an old config structure - before plpcfgbt 0.9 the program reported an error because of the config structure and stopped the plpbt.bin configuration.  \nNew parameters are hiddenusb, hiddencdrom, skippcmcia, fastpcmcia.   \n\nThe graphical frontend plpcfgbtGUI 0.1-test for plpcfgbt.exe released.  \n\n**plpgenbtldr updates:**   \nxo output removed.  \nplpbtldr.bin writes an error info text when there was problem with loading plpbt.bin.   \n\n**plpchk.exe:**   \nplpchk.exe is a new dos tool to detect plop usb driver from config.sys, from a batch file or from the command line. The program can create/remove a file that can be checked for existence and it returns the errorlevel code for batch files. You can run it in a hidden mode without any screen output.   \n\n**plpdisd.exe:**   \nUpdated to disable the usb driver used in 5.0.11   \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n**Plans/ideas for next releases:**   \nATA (CF) PC-Card support.  \nFinish USB CDROM support.  \nSupport USB 3.0.  \nSupport PXE Splitted ROM\u0027s.  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n[http://www.plop.at/e...mngrusblog.html](http://www.plop.at/en/bootmngrusblog.html \"External link\")  \n\nbest regards  \nelmar   \n"

It didn\u0027t create plpback.bin as far as I can see.\nthen i think you used \"plpinstc.com\" and not \"plpinst.com\".   \nplpback.bin will be created only when you use plpinst.com. the C in plpinstc.com stands for CDROM and as you know, cdrom\u0027s are not writeable and so this installer version does not create the backup file plpback.bin. but this is written in the warning text when you start plpinstc.com. plpinstc.com is additionally always used when writing to a drive is not possible, like running from another boot managers and so on....  \n\n\u003e - how exactly to uninstall Plop? Why did you hide this info and routing from users?\nhey, i do not hide this info. but i assume, when somebody is fit enough to use a boot manager then he can understand the option \"UNINSTALL\" in the installer program. the uninstall option is the opposite of the install option. simply choose it and the boot manager will be removed. is this really so difficult???  \n\nhowever, when you press ctrl-f on the boot manager site and you search for \"uninstall\", then you will find there infos too.  \n\n\u003e - why complete unistall is only possible from Floppy? Why not write plpback.bin when installing from DOS or Win Boot Menu?\nuninstall is possible from dos!  \nwhy only floppy? because a floppy is writeable and an external storage and not affected when something bad happened with the hard disk.   \nthe install program supports only FAT. when the install program is started from floppy, then there is a fat and the installer can write the plpback.bin (backup of modified sectors) to the floppy.   \nwhen the install program is started from the windows boot menu, then there is no connection to any partition to write the backup file. to provide the writing of the backupfile from the windows boot menu i had to add ntfs and partition mounting routines to the installer. thats a lot of work. when people don\u0027t want to install the boot manager to the hard disk, then there is still the option to run the boot manager from the windows boot menu without installing it to the mbr.  \n\nhowever, the complete uninstall with plpback.bin was made if something really bad happened when the boot manager was installed. normally its enough to write a new mbr when you dont want to have the boot manager any more. and this option is also available in the install program.  \n\n\u003e - did you aslo update plpgenbtldr-0.7.zip for this release?\nyes, but only minor changes  \n\n\u003e - My Plop install has only one USB Boot menu option. How to select a USB device to boot from, if several are connected to the PC? Ctrl option is not convenient compare to device list in Boot Menu.\nbecause the usb drivers are loaded on demand. one device after another is detected when you use the usb option. i have less then 32kb available to put all the boot manager to the place before the first partition starts. so i think the solution with the ctrl key is more that you can expect from such a small and feature rich program.  \n\n\u003e - Why Boot from CD menu option doesn\u0027t result in booting from internal CD-Rom Drive (with Windows install \\\u0026 repair CD as an example)?\nthe cd boot option in the menu is only for ide cdrom drives and you can boot any cd\u0027s/dvd\u0027s. i think you have a sata cd drive and sata cd drives are not supported (see FAQ).   \n\n\u003e - can you add Boot from ISO option to Plop Boot Menu?

Also, if a Linux partition is between Windows partitions, should it be counted at all, when booting with Plop?  \n\nMore broadly, should a Linux partition be counted, when booting by any means, including Grub4dos, to Windows or ISO file located on Windows partition?  \n\nThe only thing, you didn\u0027t explain - why Plop can\u0027t boot ISO images? I guess, its also due to space limitation - easy to guess. ![:dubbio:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/dubbio.gif) I do have a SATA CD-ROM though - that explains why it didn\u0027t boot. It looks from your answer, if one will type Help in Command Prompt after Plop installer\u0027s file name, all options get listed, including Uninstall - users should figure that out.  \n\nThanks again for your very helpful program! I found it just recently, but can\u0027t imaging how to boot from USB in VMs without it.

It would help to ID them exactly as they ID\u0027d in BIOS, since that\u0027s where Plop gets IDs from.\nthe boot manager checks the existence of 4 hard disks. 80h to 83h, those are the bios numbers. no labels or anything else. when you see hda then its the drive 80h and this is the first hard disk that the bios provides. the bios does not provide hard disk names. ok, they display them in list, but they do a direct hardware access and reading this info from the device. i would be able to do the same (like i do for ide cdrom drives + showing the device name when the driver was loaded), but this would mean that i have to write many sata drivers to access the hardware. a bios is specialized to a motherboard, so it needs only one sata driver. the boot manager must run on different hardware, so it became a never ending story of writing drivers. dont forget, the boot manager is no operating system.  \n\n\u003e Another thing \"I should know\" is partition count.

I guess, its also due to space limitation - easy to guess. ![:hi:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/hi.gif)\n1) because the iso file is stored on a file system. to access the iso, i have to write drivers for file systems ntfs, ext2/3/4 and many more.  \n\n2) a new driver is required to provide the iso-\\\u003ecdrom emulation. that means, the boot manager will be bigger and there is no space left.  \n\n\u003e if one will type Help in Command Prompt after Plop installer\u0027s file name, all options get listed, including Uninstall - users should figure that out.\ni dont think that many people are using the installation from dos. however, the readme.txt is available and the website too. they can get their infos from there.  \n\n\u003e To clarify about Plop Boot Menu listings:  \n\u003e\n\u003e HDC Partition1  \n\u003e HDC Partition2  \n\u003e HDC Partition3  \n\u003e HDC Partition4  \n\u003e HDD Partition1  \n\u003e HDD Partition2  \n\u003e HDD Partition3  \n\u003e\n\u003e See, drive letters are assigned to each drive partitions differently depending on what partition you booted from this time.

      "content": "Thanks Elmar!  \n\nRegarding \"Toshiba not booting from Plop HD List\", I got the reason you posted (one must select that USB drive as 1-st in BIOS), but not completely. Following same logic, how Plop can possibly boot a 2-nd or 3-d IDE HD from its HD List, when 1-st IDE HD is selected in BIOS as boot disk? If Plop has a routing to bypass that BIOS setting (some call Plop a BIOS Extender), why don\u0027t apply in next Plop release the same routing to USB drives presented in Plop HD List?  \n\nRegarding \"Toshiba not booting from Plop USB List\", as I explained above, Plop is incorporated into EasyBCD Bootloader as its Boot Menu item. When Plop is selected in EasyBCD Boot Menu, Grub4dos bootloader, also incorporated into EasyBCD, boots Plop ISO. Once Plop ISO has booted and presents its Boot Menu list, I assume its no longer relevant, by what means it was booted. You select a USB drive in Plop and its supposed to boot it, but it hangs. I did not configure ISOLinux, which I pressume is part of Plop routing to boot USB drives. The immediately preceding Menu is Plop Boot Menu List, before that its just EasyBCD Boot Menu. Keep in mind, this setup works time-to-time with Sandisk Flash (i.e. Plop boots it when called from EasyBCD via NeoGrub), but never works with Toshiba USB (JMicron USB enclosure chipset). Hence, the cause seems to be not in how Plop started, but in its driver not working with JMicron chipset correctly.  \n\nThe reason I posted it, to give you a better idea what happen, and may be a better chance to fix it. Its NOT a critique of Plop, but only a constructive desire to improve its functionality and usability. The easy way for a developer to say may be that users are stupid. But at the end you write it for those stupid users I assume. If it doesn\u0027t work in a standard scenario of calling Plop from another Boot Manager (you say on your website, its a popular way to use Plop), it should be fixed. If there are flaws in its usability, as identified by users, they need to be addressed. That\u0027s how I see the whole point, but I was wrong before... :smile:   \n\n**Edited by sambul61, 25 October 2010 - 02:55 PM.**\n"

      "content": "Elmar,  \n\nEasyBCD installs Plop from its own .exe, its V5.0.x (didn\u0027t check, but you can see by file dates on my pic above). I just replaced it with V5.0.11 , and the result is similar. Here are my test results:  \n\nOn a real PC (regardless on how many USB devices are connected):  \n- Plop hangs on booting Toshiba USB to black screen without messages;  \n- Plop hangs on booting Sandisk Blade causing immediate PC reboot;  \n- Plop hangs on finding empty Y-Data Card Reader (it should offer to find next USB device).  \n\nOn a VMWare VM (all devices are represented as generic VMWare USB device):  \n- Plop boots Sandisk Cruiser, Toshiba USB, and offers to find next device after checking empty Y-Data Card Reader and finding no boot sector;  \n- [Plop always hangs on booting a second USB device regardless what device is it.](http://i52.tinypic.com/whfw45.jpg \"External link\") Yet it always boots the 1-st USB device after some initial training.  \n\nHence, no lack so far on booting any USB device I\u0027ve with Plop on a PC. Yet Plop V10 booted at times Sandisk Cruiser. What\u0027s interesting, initially Plop hangs several times on booting any USB device inside a VM, then it adapts somehow and starts booting the 1-st USB device every time. Given the fact its not a writable .iso, and the VM has no OS installed, how such stable adaptation is possible? Possibly the WinXP VM writes own logs about successful system boot, which Plop accesses next boot to refine its device boot params (I guess its too much for Plop to handle). :smile:   \n\n**Edited by sambul61, 26 October 2010 - 03:28 AM.**\n"

      "content": "Another issue that came up with Plop V11, when having several drives connected to a PC:  \n\n- when choosing from Plop Hard Drive Boot Menu any bootable partition of the 1-st boot drive selected in BIOS, it boots OK;  \n- when choosing a bootable partition from any other HD (not the 1-st one), Plop hangs with \"Invalid boot.ini file\" error message.  \n\nWell, of course, when connecting different drive combinations to the PC periodically, each of their partitions\u0027 boot.ini files points to 0 drive, as it may be the only drive used next time. Again, since Plop is called a BIOS Extender, its expected to perform just that role, meaning in this scenario that once you select a particular drive and partition from Plop HD Boot Menu, it will interpret its boot.ini such a way that allows to boot from that partition despite its not on the 1-st drive this time in BIOS settings. In other words, if the boot.ini says \"rdisk (0)\", Plop should interpret it as \"rdisk (n)\", where \"n\" is the position of the drive this time in BIOS drive lineup.  \n\nAnother suggestion along the same lines would be for Plop to search for boot.ini, when its missing on the volume, which is the case, when EasyBCD is installed on another volume of the same drive. Let say, EasyBCD is installed on a Win7 volume, and includes in its boot menu a WinXP volume on the same drive. In this case EasyBCD will delete boot.ini on WinXP volume and add ebcd.001 file in Win7 root. Plop can search, read and re-interpret ebcd.001 on Win7 volume instead of boot.ini on WinXP. What I mean, is a bit more intelligent treatment of found boot irregularities. ![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif) I hear your answer: \"limited file size\". But the point is, in a system with periodically changed drive combo Plop doesn\u0027t work as expected by a (stupid) user. For Plop to work, BIOS settings must be changed each time, thus making Plop redundant.  \n\nTrying to be objective, Grub4DOS, when installed separately on each HD, neither works properly in described scenario, unless bended dynamically via typing config entries at boot time. Say, I boot from 1-st drive, then select Grub4DOS in its boot menu, then select a second drive in Grub4DOS menu, then select Grub4DOS in the 2-nd drive menu once opened, and it fails to boot from an ISO file located on a volume on the 2-nd drive due to no intelligent volume remapping.   \n\n**Edited by sambul61, 29 October 2010 - 07:15 PM.**\n"

BUT DO NOT INSTALL WINDOWS NOW. :smile:   \n\nwhen usb boot works, then install the plop boot manager to your mbr. [(click here for the info how to do that)](http://www.plop.at/en/bootmanager.html#wininst \"External link\")  \ni know both howto\u0027s are looking looking similar, but they are different. at first you use plpbt.bin and then you use plpinstc.com, so read carefully.  \n\nwhen everything works fine then install xp from usb.  \n\ngood luck  \n\nbest regards  \nelmar   \n\n**Edited by BiTByte, 30 November 2010 - 01:38 PM.**\n"

The driver didn\u0027t detect usb drives on some machines although 5.0.10 detected the drives.  \n\n**Plop Boot Manager 5.0.12-test1 released**   \n\nNew main menu hotkey ALT-u. You can skip usb devices before the boot manager identifies the device. The usb driver must be small and has no full error handling implemented. Sometimes, the boot manager hangs during the usb device identification because of the missing error handling. Mostly its because of internal bluetooth adapters. With ALT-u you are able to skip those devices. When you don\u0027t always want to press ALT-u to skip the devices manually, then you can set the number of devices to skip in the boot manager setup. The setup option to skip mass storage devices has been replaced with the new feature.   \n\nThe keys for skipping devices when you use CTRL-u or ALT-u are now  \ns ... skip device (in 5.0.11 it was \"n\" for next device)  \nenter ... identify/boot device (in 5.0.11 it was any key press)  \n\nBooting from 2nd, 3rd or 4th hard disk activates now an int13 driver that swaps the hard disk drive number. Why wasn\u0027t that implemented earlier? I was meaning that its part of the operating system to handle the correct drive number when its booting from a hard disk number \\\u003e80h. I changed my thinking because of a good argument of sambul61 at \u003chttp://reboot.pro.\u003e The edit of the boot flag hard disk number in the \"linked partitions\" setup became useless and has been removed.  \n\nbest regards  \nelmar   \n"
