I was able to personaly verify that following\n\nports are functional: i386-pc, mipsel-yeeloong (including as firwmare),\n\nsparc64-ieee1275, powerpc-ieee1275. Additionaly automated tests were\n\ndone with qemu.\n\nHowever I can\u0026#39;t verify everything myself. So please give it a good test,\n\nespecially if you have a particular hardware, configuraton or requirements.\n\n\n\nThe release file is bigger than it should be because of autogeneration\n\nissues. Other than the size these issues have no impact but their fixing\n\nis scheduled for next release.\n\n\n\nThe release is scheduled 2 weeks from now.\n\n\n\nGRUB, also known as the GRand Unified Bootloader, is a modular, portable\n\nbootloader that supports a number of platforms, including standard\n\nBIOS-based\n\nPCs, IEEE-1275 platforms (such as the OLPC and some PowerPC/Sparc64\n\nhardware), coreboot, the free (as in freedom) pre-boot initialization\n\nframework, and Yeeloong, free (as in freedom)\n\nLoongson-2F-based (MIPS compliant CPU) laptop.\n\nThis time we also include the ability of GRUB to be firmware on Yeeloong.\n\nThis is also the first time we officially include ZFS support.\n\nOther major improvements include (extract from NEWS file):\n\n\n\n* Keyboard layouts support.\n\n\n\n* Parser for GRUB Legacy configuration files.\n\n\n\n* Extend `vbeinfo\u0026#39; and `vbetest\u0026#39; commands to non-VBE graphics, as\n\n  `videoinfo\u0026#39; and `videotest\u0026#39;.\n\n\n\n* New `lsefisystab\u0026#39;, `lssal\u0026#39;, and `lsefimmap\u0026#39; commands on EFI platforms.\n\n\n\n* Support explicit user claim that a device is BIOS-visible.  Devices\n\n  listed in device.map will be assumed to be readable using only BIOS\n\n  facilities, rather than anything more complex such as LVM or RAID.\n\n\n\n* New bash-completion script for GRUB utilities.\n\n\n\n* Use ACPI to shut down if possible.\n\n\n\n* New `lsacpi\u0026#39; command.\n\n\n\n* New `--boot-directory\u0026#39; option to `grub-install\u0026#39;, `grub-reboot\u0026#39;, and\n\n  `grub-set-default\u0026#39;, with clearer semantics than the previous\n\n  `--root-directory\u0026#39; option.\n\n\n\n* Rename CD-ROM device to \"cd\" on BIOS platforms.\n\n\n\n* Transparent decompression filters.\n\n\n\n* Simpler PXE image generation.  New `grub-mknetdir\u0026#39; utility to generate\n\n  netboot directory trees.\n\n\n\n* New relocator.  Allows for more kernel support and more\n\n  straightforward loader writing.\n\n\n\n* Handle USB pendrives exposed as floppies.\n\n\n\n* New Automake-based build system.\n\n\n\n* Add `sendkey\u0026#39; command (i386-pc only).\n\n\n\n* Support 1.x versions of mdadm metadata.\n\n\n\n* Fix corruption when reading Reiserfs directory entries.\n\n\n\n* Bidirectional text and diacritics support.\n\n\n\n* Change grub-mkdevicemap to emit /dev/disk/by-id/ names where possible\n\n  on GNU/Linux.\n\n\n\n* Add `grub-mkconfig\u0026#39; support for Xen with Linux.\n\n\n\n* Add `grub-mkconfig\u0026#39; support for initrd images on Fedora 13.\n\n\n\n* Support \u003e3GiB and \u003c16MiB RAM in i386-qemu.\n\n\n\n* Add support for Cirrus 5446 and Bochs video cards.\n\n\n\n* Load more appropriate video drivers automatically in `grub-mkconfig\u0026#39;.\n\n\n\n* USB improvements, including hotplugging/hotunplugging, hub support,\n\n  and USB serial support.\n\n\n\n* AMD Geode CS5536 support.\n\n\n\n* Extensive updates to the Texinfo documentation.\n\n\n\n* Add `grub-probe\u0026#39; support for the btrfs filesystem, permitting / to\n\n  reside on btrfs as long as /boot is on a filesystem natively supported\n\n  by GRUB.\n\n\n\n* Handle symbolic links under /dev/mapper on GNU/Linux.\n\n\n\n* Handle installation across multiple partition table types.\n\n\n\n* Add `cmostest\u0026#39; command (i386/x86_64 only).\n\n\n\n* Add support for DM-RAID disk devices on GNU/Linux.\n\n\n\n* Remove `grub-mkisofs\u0026#39;.  `grub-mkrescue\u0026#39; now uses GNU xorriso to build\n\n  CD images.\n\n\n\n* `grub-mkrescue\u0026#39; support for EFI, coreboot, and QEMU platforms.\n\n\n\n* Unify `grub-mkimage\u0026#39;, `grub-setup\u0026#39;, and `grub-install\u0026#39; source code\n\n  across platforms.\n\n\n\n* Fix VGA (as opposed to VBE) video driver, formerly a terminal driver.\n\n\n\n* Add menu hotkey support.\n\n\n\n* Add support for the nilfs2 filesystem.\n\n\n\n* `grub-probe\u0026#39; and `grub-mkconfig\u0026#39; support for NetBSD.\n\n\n\n* Support setting a background image in `grub-mkconfig\u0026#39;.\n\n\n\n* Support multiple terminals in `grub-mkconfig\u0026#39;.\n\n\n\n* Regexp support.\n\n\n\n* MIPS multiboot2 support.\n\n\n\n* Multiboot2 tag support.\n\n\n\n* sunpc partition table support.\n\n\n\n* Add a number of new language features to GRUB script: `for\u0026#39;, `while\u0026#39;,\n\n  `until\u0026#39;, `elif\u0026#39;, function parameters, `break\u0026#39;, `continue\u0026#39;, `shift\u0026#39;,\n\n  multi-line quoted strings, positional parameters with `setparams\u0026#39;,\n\n  `return\u0026#39;, filename wildcard expansion, and `!\u0026#39;.\n\n\n\n* Support nested partition tables.  GRUB now prefers to name partitions\n\n  in the form `(hd0,msdos1,bsd1)\u0026#39; rather than `(hd0,1,a)\u0026#39;.\n\n\n\n* Speed up consecutive hostdisk operations on the same device.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \u003chttp://www.gnu.org/software/grub/\u003e\n\n\n\nA source tarball for the new release can be found at:\n\n\n\n  http://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/grub/grub-1.99~rc1.tar.gz\n\n\n\nand its GPG detached signature [*]:\n\n\n\n  http://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/grub/grub-1.99~rc1.tar.gz.sig\n\n\n\n[*] You can use either of the above signature files to verify that\n\nthe corresponding file (without the .sig suffix) is intact.  First,\n\nbe sure to download both the .sig file and the corresponding tarball.\n\nThen, run a command like this:\n\n\n\n  gpg --verify grub-1.99~rc1.tar.gz.sig\n\n\n\nIf that command fails because you don\u0026#39;t have the required public key,\n\nthen run this command to import it:\n\n\n\n  gpg --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys E82E4209\n\n\n\nand rerun the `gpg --verify\u0026#39; command.\n\n\n\nThis release was bootstrapped with the following tools:\n\n  Autoconf 2.67\n\n  Automake 1.11.1\n\n\n\nGCC 4.4 is the recommended version for building it, although any version\n\nstarting with 4.1.3 is supported in this release.\n\n\n\nI hope you enjoy using GRUB as much as we enjoyed developing it.\n\n\n\n-- \n\nRegards\n\nVladimir \u0026#39;√è-coder/phcoder\u0026#39; Serbinenko\n```\n\nhttp://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/grub-devel/2011-01/msg00082.html   \n"
