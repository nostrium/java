Inside Windows (only with special driver) it has up to 100 MB/s reading.   \n\nAll my attempts to install XP Pro on the SSD not worked, cause XP Installer not find the card (nlighting xp-sony-driver + hitachi microdrive filter driver \\*inside xp the card becomes with the second \"fixed\" \\*).  \n\nAlso I cannot use SanDisk fixing tool (for \u0027removal\u0027 to \u0027fixed\u0027 state cause the card is on PCIe, not IDE/SATA.  \n\nOn Bios - thinkpad t60 - theres no possibility to boot from PCIe.   \n\nIn XP I can make Low-level-Formating with tool \"activekilldisk\".

That makes sense.  \n\nNone of this helps us though.  \n\nThere is the J-Micron driver which could be slipstreamed with n-lite, but this will only get you through setup.  \n\nDo we need to do any boosector copying (I saw something earlier with hexadecimal address\u0027) that need to be copied from a working hd to the ssd?  \n\nWell, I\u0027m no expert on this. I do know that IBM HD diagnostic tool does see the EC SSD, so why can\u0027t grub? Is there some special driver installed with IBM HD diagnostic tool? Probably, what is it so we can install it into grub so grub can see the device?  \n\nThat\u0027s the only thing I can think of, otherwise it would have to be chainloading using an image on the ssd.  \n\nIs there a way to make a windows pe bootloader?  \n\nI do know that once one device boots up, once it hands control over to the ssd, the ssd has lost sight of itself (unless the J micron driver is in place?).  \n\nreference from jmicron on the jmb36x and grub  \n\n[http://www.jmicron.c...upport_FAQ.html](http://www.jmicron.com/Support_FAQ.html \"External link\")   \n"

I\u0027m going to use HP USB format tool to see if I can format the expresscard with a fat32 windows 98 bootdisk and try to create the boot entry to boot from it. If that works, then the next logical thing is to see if I can install windows onto it (possibly using the sata driver that\u0027s needed).  \n\n...  \n\nI don\u0027t think I was correct in it being hd2,1, when I removed it (as I\u0027ve checked with the \u003data installation), the ls entry would dissapear (the partition would, the device would show up as an ata device, but just not ata4,1).  \n\nAnyways, I formatted the expresscard in my lt, and put it in my desktop, and when I did a root (hd2,1), it didn\u0027t recognize the fs, which leads me to believe it was actually seeing my usb memory card reader.  \n\nSo to make a long story short, I think the \u003data install switch needs to be used when installing grub2.  \n\nhere\u0027s tutorials on grub2  \n[http://ubuntuforums....d.php?t\u003d1195275](http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t\u003d1195275 \"External link\")  \n\n[http://www.dedoimedo...ers/grub-2.html](http://www.dedoimedo.com/computers/grub-2.html \"External link\")  \n\n...  \n\nI don\u0027t know what happened. I did the ata install (putting the \u003data before the last option in the grub-install command), and I didn\u0027t get the same view I got first time when booting from usb flash drive and choosing c for command prompt and then running ls. It only sees hd0-2, when in ubuntu, it installs with hd0-3 (before I got ata devices instead of hd devices). I\u0027m assuming being the ssd. So maybe the \u003data switch needs to be the last option inputted when running the grub-install command.  \n\n...  \n\nokay, I\u0027m back where I was in post #99 (beginning of this post)  \n\nI had to boot from the cd vs the flash drive and reinstall the grub (I also formatted the usb drive again, pretty much going through the process in post #99 up to step 6, modifying the install to \"grub-install --disk-module\u003data --root-directory\u003d/mnt/USB /dev/sdx\"  \n\nWhen I boot, I get \"error no such disk (there\u0027s no grub scripts in place), but I know I\u0027m seeing the expresscard, when I run \"ls\" I see ata8 ata8,1 and on the laptop I see ata4 ata4,1. When I remove the expresscard and run ls, the partition dissapears (I only see ata4 or only ata8 respectively). So I know the \u003data command is allowing me to see the expresscard.  \n\n...  \n\nseful info on rescue mode  \n\n[https://help.ubuntu....y/Grub2#Command](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2#Command \"External link\") Line \\\u0026 Rescue Mode  \n\nplus this from before  \n[http://planetstephan...b2-rescue-mode/](http://planetstephanie.net/2009/05/27/grub2-rescue-mode/ \"External link\")  \n\n...  \n\nif I run \"ls (ata8,1)/  \nI see the files on the expresscard from grub2 rescue mode.  \n\n...  \n\nI think I know what\u0027s happening.  \n\nBy installing grub with the ata module, all devices are seen as ata devices. In fact I get an atapi error when I run the ls command in rescue mode.  \n\nIf I mount any device other than my expresscard, the filesystem is unknown.  \n\nWhich is why I get the rescue mode in the first place, grub can\u0027t read from the flash drive that I have grub running on, disabling the grub.cfg file.  \n\nHmm, a conundrum.  \n\nI\u0027m thinking really hard on this one, the website [https://help.ubuntu....ub2#Rescue Mode](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2#Rescue%20Mode \"External link\") said I should be able to use the chainloader command in rescue mode, but it\u0027s not letting me. I\u0027m trying to read more about the \u003data option during the grub install. This is indeed what gives me access to the expresscard drive, but it seems to disable the flash drive in the process, creating problems for me. There\u0027s got to be a way to specify which devices are ata, and which are not.  \n\n...  \n\nokay, I read  \n[http://en.gentoo-wik...Grub2#os-prober](http://en.gentoo-wiki.com/wiki/Grub2#os-prober \"External link\")  \n\nwhich gave me some more insights  \n\nand this site  \n\n[http://en.gentoo-wik...c_Configuration](http://en.gentoo-wiki.com/wiki/Grub2#Automatic_Configuration \"External link\")  \n\ninsmod ata at the grub2 command prompt (not using the \u003data grub-install option) gives access to ata devices.  \n\nHowever, same thing happens, once you run it at the command prompt, you lose access to the flash drive.  \n\nI think it needs to be ran at once, such as a script.  \n\nI\u0027m thinking  \nboot from the USB  \nchoose to edit the GRUB command  \ninsmod ATA  \nset root\u003d(ata8,1)  \nchainloader +1  \n\nbut I think as soon as it runs the insmod ATA, it loses the ability to run grub commands.  \n\nSo now I\u0027m thinking boot from an actual HD, maybe that will still be readable as an ATA device.  \n\n...  \n\nI found this googling \"insmod ata\"  \n\nfrom  \n[http://osdir.com/ml/...1/msg00083.html](http://osdir.com/ml/grub-devel-gnu/2009-11/msg00083.html \"External link\")  \n\n\\\u003e After \u0027insmod ata\u0027, loading of further modules typically fails because \\\u003e the drive in the \u0027prefix\u0027 variable is no longer valid.\\\u003e The following works for me:\\\u003e\\\u003e # Load needed modules first\\\u003e insmod hdparm\\\u003e\\\u003e # Switch to ATA driver and load ATA pass-through support\\\u003e # (this invalidates prefix)\\\u003e insmod ata_pthru\\\u003e \\\u003e # Turn APM off\\\u003e hdparm -B 255 (ata0)\\\u003e\\\u003e -- \\\u003e Regards,\\\u003e Christian FrankeThanks Christian :-) that works now.

See if that makes a difference since the device will be booting up as ata vs hda1.  \n\nNote: I tried formatting the drive as ext2 at first, it booted, but when I got to the expresscard, I couldn\u0027t read the old drive anymore (even after insmod fat and insmod ext2)  \n\n...  \n\neven better news.  \n\nI got grub to see both drives at the same time by installing to a hd vs flash.  \n\nI had to install as \u003data mode  \n\nI can enter commands without getting the \"error no disk\"  \n\nSo now I think I just need to focus on the script. And verify my media is bootable, I think I\u0027m going to try ubuntu first, because that seems easiest.  \n\n...  \n\nI GOT IT TO START BOOTING  \n\nmy flawed logic was in set root\u003d(ata8,1)  \nwhat I was doing was mapping the grub root folder to the expresscard drive, where there are no grub files.  \n\nInstead I ran  \n\nloopback loop (ata8,1)/ubuntu-9.10-desktop-i386.iso  \nlinux (loop)/casper/vmlinuz boot\u003dcasper iso-scan/filename\u003d/ubuntu-9.10-desktop-i386.iso splash --initrd (loop)/casper/initrd.lz  \nboot  \n\nand voila, it started to boot until it got a kernel panic on the fs  \n\"kernel-panic - not syncing: vfs: unable to mount root file system on unknown-bl(8,1)\"  \n\n...  \n\nhere\u0027s the results of a win98 boot  \nset root\u003d(ata8,1)  \nchainloader +1  \nboot  \n\nreboots computer  \n\nTried installing xp to the expresscard  \n\ngrub won\u0027t boot from it, using the same method as above, it just sits there after boot with a blinking cursor.  \n\nUsed win7rescuepe  \nsearched for a win2k/xp installation  \nfound it, and flashed on the screen  \n\"Windows could not start because of a computer disk hardware configuration problem\"  \n\nI\u0027m considering slipstreaming jmicron stuff,  \n\nbut I was also thinking about delving into the hard drive hexa copying thing.  \n\nIt also means that grub4dos (used by win7rescuepe) saw my ssd   \n"

      "content": "Hi,  \n\nI have a Lenovo SL500 notebook and I am wondering if I am able to **boot Windows XP from ExpressCard SSD disk** (using internal PCI-Express bus) or maybe later try to boot from Firewire 800 external disk connected via ExpressCard. My notebook\u0027s BIOS doesn\u0027t support boot from ExpressCard.  \n\nI searched internet and also read this thread and as I understand, nobody was able to do it so far.  \n\nMy question is: Is it possible? Is it worth to try it? Should I buy the ExpressCard SSD disk and try to experiment?  \n\nPlease note: I am not a geek, just a higher level power user, so I would need some support from the community...   \n"
