Please insert drive in (letter).  \n-So at the moment is acting (or seen) like a hub,  \nwaiting for some \u0027disk space\u0027 to be inserted.  \n(I mean, is the above the way a usb drive works, ie in two parts?)  \n\nBut my real question..  \nI have knowledge of the existence of usb write filter,  \newf, though I thought for now I\u0027d be ok.   \nI think my problem is, When I copy a file from Pc hdd to usb stick, everything fine.  \nWhen I download direct the file (.html, .zip) from internet, my sticks appear to have  \nhad problems, even disapearing.  \nI downloaded htmls \\\u0026zips direct, yesterday. Today ok, +Icopied the said files to hdd,  \nbut then took out the (bootable)usb from computer, and in other computer, no boot.  \nOpened in drive hex editor, wrong cylinder count or somthing, so not able to see any hex.  \nTestdisk, too, but drive not even in selection menu. Hum.. It is dead, isn\u0027t it?  \n\nIs there a tool or a method on what to do with a dead usb? (tap it against something, open-it, blow on it with love)  \nI will google.  \nMaybe there are other factors too.   \nThank you.   \n"

      "content": "\u003e Thanks, Wonko.   \nYou are welcome ![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif), though really I thought that the general idea was clear enough from the beginning.![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif)  \n\nI\u0027ll try to re-cap (again for the benefit of future readers).  \n\nYou are going to use a \"Manufacturer tool\", a specific software that is used in factory to initialize the USB stick.  \n\nFirst step is to identify the Manufacturer, the Chipgenius tool is a good one to do so:  \n\u003chttp://reboot.pro/4661/\u003e  \nas it often provides besides the needed VID and PID of the device, the name of the Manufacturer and in some cases also the actual Controller model (or family of models).  \n\nIn this case:  \n\u003e PnP Device ID: VID \u003d 0C76 PID \u003d 0005\n\nWith the above info you go here:  \n[http://flashboot.ru/...php?name\u003diflash](http://flashboot.ru/index.php?name\u003diflash \"External link\")  \nand enter the VID and PID in the correspondent textboxes and click on the Найти (Найти\u003dFind) button.  \n\nThe result will be all entries that match given VID and PID.  \n\nIf you are lucky, you will find one or more entries with (on the left) the actual description of your model of USB stick and on the right the name of the tool (and hopefully a link to it).  \n\nPlease note how there is NOT an univocal correspondence between VID/PID and actual controller, and as in the case discusse here, the additional info given by Chipgenius is useful:  \n\u003e Chip Vendor: SSS  \n\u003e Chip Part-Number: SSS6677/SSS6690\n\nStill following this example, one of the entries with a link leads you here:  \n[http://www.flashboot...s-file-329.html](http://www.flashboot.ru/Files-file-329.html \"External link\")  \n\nIn this page at the top there is a \"SSS (Solid State System)\" text that is actually a link to the whole directory:  \n[http://www.flashboot...es\\\u0026op\u003dcat\\\u0026id\u003d17](http://www.flashboot.ru/index.php?name\u003dFiles\u0026op\u003dcat\u0026id\u003d17 \"External link\")  \nof SSS related tools.  \n\nAmong these, you will have to do some tests to find the one (or more than one) that are suitable for your USB stick.  \n\nThere are often several different versions of the same utility, not necessarily \"latest\" is the best one, and often an \"older\" version may contain a help file or some instructions, or a readme.txt about the usage.  \n\nAdditionally by using Google translate, you can usually understand enough from the user posts - that in some cases offer help with the usage, in this case also an \"older\" version will likely have more comments and it is more likely to be found in them some useful info on the usage.  \n\nAlso, the same Manufacturer may have different utilities for different scopes, so you need some time and patience (and usually a lot of ***guessing*** ![:w00t:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/w00t.gif)) in order to find the \"right\" tool, and to find the \"right\" way to use it. ![:(](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/sad.png)   \n\nKeep in mind that these are very specific tools made for engineers that need not (or like to think they need not ![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif)) instructions to use such tools.  \n\nAt a certain point you will need to choose, and the only recommendation I can give you is: ![:blink:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/blink.png)   \n[http://www.imdb.com/...uotes?qt0357926](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097576/quotes?qt0357926 \"External link\")  \n\u003e **Grail Knight:** But choose wisely, for while the true Grail will bring you life, the false Grail will take it from you.\n\n![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif)  \nWonko   \n"
