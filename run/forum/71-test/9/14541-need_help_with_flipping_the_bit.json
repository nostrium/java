      "content": "hi everyone, I have a kingston data traveler 16gb flashdrive that I boot xp/usboot from first partition but I have two more primary partitions on it and these can not be recognised in other computers and I would like to access these from other computers without having to boot the first partition, just access them as normal USB access.  \n\nI have ran chip genius but I need help selecting the correct program to \"flip the bit\" because I am having trouble with translations from chinese and russian languages to english and I find more than one option for this flashdrive.  \n\nmost importantly, is there any possibility that I can render this flashdrive useless/beyond recovery if I use the wrong program while trying to flip the bit?  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nhere are the details I get from chip genius:  \n\nDevice Name: ++USSB Mass Storage Device(KingstonDataTraveler 2.0 USB Device)  \n\nChip Vendor: skymedi  \nChip Part-Number: SK6281/SK6211  \n\nVID: 0951 PID: 1603  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nmy confusion stems mostly from the part number since it is a dual part number divided with a slash and these part numbers each have a different program for flipping the bit according to this site shown/linked in chip genius: [http://bbs.mydigit.c...ad.php?tid\u003d4345](http://bbs.mydigit.cn/read.php?tid\u003d4345 \"External link\")  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\ncan anyone help clear up my confusion on this and also, is there any danger in trying the lexar tool on this to see if it works? in other words, if the lexar tool doesnt work will it do nothing or do irreversable damage?  \n\nIm still reading translations but I wanted to ask here also. I will post if I find the answer and have success.  \n\nthanks   \n"

I believe the right utility for that is BootIt (the lexar one that you\u0027re thinking of); forget where I downloaded it but it\u0027s around here somewhere on this forum.  \nI have never used or needed to use bootit; it basically wipes the disk in the process but it should be reversible; can\u0027t speak from experience. That being said, there\u0027s always weird risks. The first time I tried to use syslinux on my old kingston datatraveler (first generation 16gb), rmprepusb reformatted it and it crashed. The disk ended up going into hardware read only mode and I had to rma it (thank the heavens for 5yr warranty).   \n"

I found mention of making it appear as fixed but no details as to how to do so.  \n\nIm gonna put this project on the back burner for now because it is consuming more time than I can justify for the benfit gained if successful. I have a smaller 4gb flashdrive that has the same issue so I may dig into that one and see if I can flip its bit instead.  \n\nI also have a sandisc 16gb U3 that is still original, not sure if its possible to flip the bit on that one either but it should be easier to find out about than this one.  \n\nthanks again for all the input on this subject. I will post back here when I get more bit flipping info.   \n"
