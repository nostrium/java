      "content": "I\u0027ve put together a fairly solid flash drive for recovery and getting back stuff. Right now, I have the following live disks on it:  \n\nSystem Rescue CD 2.0.1  \nClonezilla 1.2.6-59  \nAcronis True Image Home 2010 Recovery Disk  \nBackTrack 4 R2 (still working on this one, it doesn\u0027t run yet)  \nParted Magic 5.10  \nOphcrack 2.3.1 (XP and Vista/7 tables loaded)  \nOffline NT password and registry editor  \nMemtest 4.20 (it comes with a lot of other disks, but I like having it on my boot menu)  \nDBAN 2.2.6  \nLive Hacking CD 1.2  \nUbuntu 10.10 Desktop  \n(menu.lst entries available if anyone wants them, but I copied most of them from elsewhere. Everything tested with QEMU.)  \n\nAnyway, what I\u0027d like to ask is what would you add to this disk? I have 16GB of which only about 4-5GB is used by the above, so there\u0027s plenty of room to work with. I try to avoid redundancy in ISOs; multiple disks doing the same thing is usually a waste of space to me. What would you add to it?   \n"

      "content": "if feasible for you, i\u0027d add a small \\~1 GB VHD version of Windows XP and a \\~2 GB VHD version of Windows 7. You can use wimb\u0027s IMG_XP to make those, but it\u0027s still very much a work in progress and of course you\u0027d need the proper source ISO\u0027s. Plus I\u0027d install any search, copy, recovery, backup, defrag, registry, mbr, partition, anti-malware, your favorite web browser, and any other tools you might need or that you normally use a lot (for convenience). I\u0027d also add Win7PE with similar plugins in case the VHDs fail to boot. In fact, that\u0027s what I have on my own 16 GB emergency flash drive, plus a bunch of drivers and portable apps.  \n\nSearch and copy tools are important since often you need to search for some important files and then copy them to an external drive. I like Everything search and Locate32 for searching and FastCopy for copying. Imdisk and Pismo File Mount are all-around convenient, small, free tools for mounting images, and you probably need 7-zip or similar in case you need to open archives. Personally I like to install all the basic everyday programs I normally use onto my emergency OS\u0027s to make using them convenient.   \n"
