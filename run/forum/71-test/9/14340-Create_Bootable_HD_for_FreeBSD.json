      "content": "I have an old laptop that I want to use with pfSense as a firewall / router.  \nThe problem is that the laptop does not have a CD, nor a floppy and it will not boot from USB. (CD and floppy were included in a docking station which I don\u0027t have).  \n\nSo what I think might work is to use another computer and a USB to IDE converter to put the FreeBSD based pfSense ISO on the laptop hard drive and have it boot when reinstalled into the laptop. But I have not been able to actually make it work.  \n\nSuggestions would be greatly appreciated!  \n\nThanks!   \n\n**Edited by Snowman58, 20 April 2011 - 01:38 AM.**\n"

But I did try to run it on another computer and aimmed the installation at the USB HD. That sort of worked in that the HD would boot after I reinstalled it in the laptop. However the configuration was totally messed up, it did not recognise the memory, network devices, USB devices or even it\u0027s own HD after a certain point in the boot process.  \n\n\u003e So you connect the IDE HDD to another computer via a USB converter, partition and format it using RMPrepUSB and make it bootable and copy the files from inside the ISO to the HDD.  \nTried that using both Linux and Unetbootin-windows. In both cases the HD would indeed boot, but the pfSense install would not run because it was not a FreeBSD OS. Have not been able to find a way to prep the USB HD using FreeBSD. Does RMPrepUSB allow using FreeBSD?  \n\n\u003e What if you download an IMG file (e.g. 4G one) and then use RMPrepUSB File\\\u003eUSB to copy the image over to the HDD?  \n\nI have not tried that - I will go get a copy of RMPrepUSB and see what happens.  \n\nThanks!   \n"

And install FreeBSD on it from inside the virtual machine. Would that work for you?  \n\nAnother option might be installing the Plop boot manager on the \"bad HDD\" so that it can be put back inside the problem computer and hopefully boot your USB devices afterwards.   \n"
