Unfortunately, i noticed only today, that i forgot to copy the bootsector too.  \n\nIs there a way to just write the bootsector (for NTLDR) to the USB-Stick without, having to format it too?  \nSeems RMPrepUSB does not offer this option.  \n\n![:happy_dance:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/celebrate14.gif)   \n"

If you post your boot sector, I will post a modified one for NTLDR. Or you could boot **Recovery Console** and use the [**FIXBOOT** command](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/314058 \"External link\").   \n"
