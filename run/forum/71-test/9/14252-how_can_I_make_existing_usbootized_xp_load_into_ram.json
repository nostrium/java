If you removed all PE1 components you would still have a lot of unlicensed XP components left! The same tutorial principal can be applied to any XP OS. The Q was how to make it boot from RAM - whether the XP version will work or not will depend on how the XP image has been modified.   \n"

I can shrink the partition but I dont have much experience with image files so can you recommend a suitable program that you know will work for this?

      "content": "\u003e ...recommend a suitable program that you know will work for this?  \nI enjoy **DD** . What you want is a \"raw\" (sector-by-sector) image file. DD from Linux works nicely. [DD for Windows](http://www.chrysocome.net/dd \"External link\") works too, but it\u0027s a Bad Idea to capture your image if you are booted from the disk you are capturing the image from. That is, it\u0027d be best to boot from some other Windows if you are going to use DD for Windows.  \n\n```\ndd if\u003d\\\\.\\PhysicalDrive1 of\u003dzoso_win.hdd --progress\n\n```\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nOther folks might have other suggestions; there are many options for capturing such an image file.  \n\n\u003e ...I have booted a few .iso files but not image files as of yet so I will read up on that also.  \nActually, an .ISO *is* an image file; a CD/DVD image file rather than an HDD image file. You can capture an .ISO from a CD using DD for Windows with:  \n\n```\ndd if\u003d\\\\.\\CdRom0 of\u003dsome.iso bs\u003d2048 --progress\n\n```\n\nAn .ISO can be as simple as an ISO9660 filesystem, or it can be a \"hybrid\" image with other filesystems, as well.   \n"
