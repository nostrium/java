      "content": "Ok so I have made tremendous progress. I now have a bootable hd that boots up into grub4dos and will install windows xp. Here is where the problem comes in to play. It only works once. After that, I must remake the had. It changes the boot sequence(I think it changes the mbr, but I don\u0027t want someone to say that it doesn\u0027t)so that it runs the boot.ini file. Now in theory I could add an entry to the boot.ini file that would load grub which would in turn load the xp install but that sounds strange. Also I have heard that even if I did that, the xp install will delete certain files which will turn the installation base into inoperable. There have been many topics written about this for a usb install (which don\u0027t work for me anyways since my usb is too big or never boots), but i have never seen anything written for a hd install. I want this because I as much of a newbie that I am, I will be handing this computer over to a bigger newbie and he will probably have no prayer of reinstalling windows other than calling me again. While that is a good way to generate business, it\u0027s not my cup of tea. I would like to give him a solution for the next time.   \n"

There is a usb cd rom that he bought but I can\u0027t boot anything off of it. Anyways I have decided that basically almost all install scenarios have an issue with them since windows will write to the boot sector which essentially means that my friend will just have 1 time to install and then it will never work again. So I have decided on installing once with drivers and then going with a ghosting scenario.   \n"
