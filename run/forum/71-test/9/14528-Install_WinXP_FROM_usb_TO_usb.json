But when it finished (ages later), i got a BSOD in the end of the process when it was about to start windows.  \n\nI\u0027m pretty lost, and any help is welcome   \n"

There are good tutorials for that, like [this one](http://www.ngine.de/article/id/8 \"External link\") but just do whatever you did for the first (working) UFD and you should be fine.  \n\nAbove link is old and I can\u0027t find the one I want on the web so here\u0027s an archive of the updated tutorial: [Emanuel-XPUSB.rar](http://www.mediafire.com/file/nofwn6bdne9v6pr/Emanuel-XPUSB.rar \"External link\")  \n\n![:thumbup:](https://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/thumbup.gif)   \n"

      "content": "OK Wonko...  \nHere i go.  \n\n1st try, i edited USB.IN_, USBPORT.IN_, USBSTOR.IN_, TXTSETUP.SIF, and added lines related to the usb drivers, so the windows setup would try to load them as \"System Reserved\" or \"Boot Bus Estended\".  \n\n2nd try, i normally installed windows xp on my pendrive, then after the 1st reboot, when the windows asks to reboot, i got into my WinPE, loaded registry, and made the same changes manually, i edit the keys:  \n\nHKLM,\"SYSTEM\\\\CurrentControlSet\\\\Services\\\\USBSTOR\"  \nHKLM,\"SYSTEM\\\\CurrentControlSet\\\\Services\\\\usbehci\"  \nHKLM,\"SYSTEM\\\\CurrentControlSet\\\\Services\\\\usbhub\"  \nHKLM,\"SYSTEM\\\\CurrentControlSet\\\\Services\\\\usbuhci\"  \nHKLM,\"SYSTEM\\\\CurrentControlSet\\\\Services\\\\usbohci\"  \n\nI change/add the entries:  \nLoadOrderGroup \u003d Boot Bus Extender  \nStartType \u003d 0  \n\nThen sometimes i get a BDOS 0x7B and sometimes i have nothing... just some errors like missing hal.dll or couldnt creat folders inside my pendrive.  \nThe same is made in both methods, but just manually or more manually.  \n\nSo, now i\u0027m able to use an USB CDROM, so its kinda easies i guess.  \nSo... i only need to install windows xp sp3 on a USB Flash Pendrive 16GB Kingston. I can use another pendrive or an USB CD/DVD ROM.   \n"

But as i said, i\u0027m now using an USB CD, so i\u0027m using isos burned into CDS.  \n\nThe erros i got are related to the pendrive in wich i want to install windows... sometimes it can\u0027t create folders in it, sometimes it doesnt  \nlet me start the install... but its all related on how i prepared the pendrive... i\u0027m using RMPrepTool, wich made the job, and now i\u0027m able to install the setup to a pendrive.  \n\nI wanted to install from pendrive1 to pendrive2 becouse the Harddisk controller is damaged, and there is no internal HardDisk. It used to be those expansive SSD cards, wich i do not intend to fix or buy. So i want to install in a pendrive, and later, i\u0027ll fix it permanently in the netbook, directlly in the mb.  \n\nUnforutnally, this is a specific case... i dont have any compatible internal hard disk to use, even for a short time. All i have to work is:  \n- 1 Kingston 16GB datatraveler G3  \n- 1 Kingston 4GB Datatraveler 100G2  \n- 1 External USB CD/DVD Drive  \n- 1 Mini DELL with no HardDisk and 3 USB ports  \n\nI\u0027m not good in explaining, as i didnt know exactlly what i was goind.. now i\u0027m getting more knowledgement, and so, i can explain it better.   \nSorry if wasnt able to explain myself, but i\u0027m trying dude.  \nI\u0027ll be really glad if you can help me.   \n"
