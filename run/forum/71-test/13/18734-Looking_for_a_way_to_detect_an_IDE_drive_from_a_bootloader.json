      "content": "Today\u0027s tricky boot scenario. I have bought a HDD caddy for a laptop, which allows me to use a hard drive in place of the (IDE) optical drive. As I predicted, the BIOS does not detect that this drive exists. That would be ok, since any modern OS doesn\u0027t care about what BIOS is saying and can detect the drive anyway. But then there\u0027s the actual boot process.\n\nMy current setup consists of Windows 7+GRUB4DOS on the primary disk (ie the the one that is detected \"normally\") and a Linux install on the secondary one. I can already boot the Linux installation by moving the kernel and initrd to a place that GRUB4DOS can read it. However, that means manual work every time there\u0027s a kernel update or similar. My goal is to detect the secondary drive in some way so that it\u0027s accessible in the boot land and can be chainloaded. So for example something like:\n\nmagicallydetect (hd1)\n\nrootnoverify (hd1)\n\nchainloader (hd1)+1\n\nI *have* done similar things before, on a very old laptop (Pentium 100 MHz era) where the HDD caddy was missing and was using some non-standard connector (like most laptops at the time) but the CD-ROM drive was using a standard mini IDE footprint. For that laptop, there was obviously no HDD that the BIOS could detect, so my solution was a floppy with OnTrack boot manager which would enable access to the HDD, which I could then boot to using whatever method. Before I try mucking around with OnTrack, I\u0027d like to know whether there\u0027s a simple way to just tell G4D (or another appropriate bootloader) about the existing disk.\n\nAnd yes, I somewhat do this for the sport of it. :smile:\n\n"

DM957-boot.img is a copy of the original file where I\u0027ve deleted some files ...\n\nYep :smile:, if you could list the files that remain and also the whole config.sys and autoexec.bat, that would make it possible to attempt replicating it.  \nI see now that we were talking of completely different diskettes, the one you linked to is a sort of \"generic\" boot floppy with the OnTrack DDO, the one I was talking about is an IBM disk manager boot diskette.  \n\u003e The disk is 160 GB big. But the BIOS is from 2008, so much newer than 2001 meaning that the 137 GB limit should not be an issue at all.\n\nWell, at least with a few BIOS (even VERY recent), particularly on notebooks, the USB stack does have LBA28 limitations (and/or detection of USB connected drives is either faulty or non-existant), depending on the make/model of the stupid thingy (and consequently on the amount of stupidity of the BIOS developers) I wouldn\u0027t be surprised that they used for that \"IDE port\" an \"old\" BIOS module of some kind.\n\nA Disk Drive Overlay is often \"connected\" to disk size (and CHS/LBA limits) that\u0027s the reason why I was asking, I thought possible ![:unsure:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/unsure.png) that the issue is \\*somehow\\* \"HD size\" related.\n\nBut I now understand that we are maybe inside a much trickier (lost in the midst of time) kind of thing, possibly not completely unlike:  \n[ftp://ftp.seagate.com/techsuppt/misc/dos5info.txt](ftp://ftp.seagate.com/techsuppt/misc/dos5info.txt \"External link\")  \n\u003e With DOS 4 and DOS 5, few conditions really REQUIRE Disk  \n\u003e Manager or any similar device driver. In general the following basic  \n\u003e rules apply:  \n\u003e\n\u003e a. Any XT system will not need Disk Manager.  \n\u003e b. Any SCSI drive will not need Disk Manager.  \n\u003e c. Most RLL and ESDI drives will not need Disk Manager.  \n\u003e d. AT systems with matching CMOS drive types will not need  \n\u003e Disk Manager.  \n\u003e e. AT systems with \"custom\" or \"user-definable\" CMOS drive  \n\u003e types will not need Disk Manager.  \n\u003e f. Seagate ST01/02, ST05X, ST11M/R, or ST21/22M/R  \n\u003e controllers and host adapters will not need Disk  \n\u003e Manager.  \n\u003e\n\u003e In other words, if you have an AT system with either an MFM or++**AT\n\u003e (ide) interface drive that is NOT supported in the CMOS drive type\n\u003e table and is without \"Custom\" drive types**++ , then the Disk Manager  \n\u003e program MAY be needed. In the case of the MFM drives, the ST22M 1 to  \n\u003e 1 16-bit controller with on-board bios is an inexpensive way to work  \n\u003e around the problem. Similar host adapter solutions with on-board BIOS  \n\u003e are available for the AT (ide) drives as well.\n\nAaaah ....the good ol\u0027 times when BIOSes were coded \"casually\" , no, wait ![:unsure:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/unsure.png), besides your particular issue ![:(](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/sad.png), we are (or will soon be) back to the SAME kind of issues with EFI ![:whistling:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/happy22.gif) ![:frusty:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/frusty.gif)\n\n\u003e Will try SBM.\n\nGood. :smile:\n\nNow that maybe I have more clear the issue, there is also another thing to try/have a look at (possibly OT/unneeded/NOT suitable):\n\n[http://code.google.c...euniversalbios/](http://code.google.com/p/xtideuniversalbios/ \"External link\")\n\n[http://code.google.c...i/Manual_v2_0_0](http://code.google.com/p/xtideuniversalbios/wiki/Manual_v2_0_0 \"External link\")\n\nThough I have no idea if it can be of use and actually how to use it in practice ![:ph34r:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/scared9.gif) (i.e. NOT using a add-on card and an EPROM), like chainloading/loading it as a \"module\" (or whatever) with grub4dos or GRUB2.  \n\n![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif)  \nWonko\n\n"
