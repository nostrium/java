So can I have a computer with pretty much full functionality that only works if you have the windows 7 live cd?\n\nYes.\n\nMost probably you are NOT having a \"windows 7 live cd\", but rather a PE 3.x made out of Windows 7 sources (a PE is not a live Windows 7, it is a PE).\n\nBUT there are THREE issues, one of probably no relevance, and one with big relevance.\n\n1. The disk might be not \"completely\" empty anymore (you might not care about it, as - at the most could be the writing of the Disk Signature in the MBR and/or the MBR code itself written to it)\n2. The system may \"decide\" to write on the internal disk a pagefile (this may happen or may not depending on a lot of possible settings/choices)\n3. The system will be EXTREMELY slow unless you use a \"RAM booted\" PE (or mini-windows 7).\n\nSince it doesn\u0027t really make sense to have a completely empty hard disk, issue #1 has only some relevance if the scope of the PE is \"exact copy\" or \"forensics\".\n\nAs well #2 is a relatively minor possible issue, if there is another Windows NT installed to the hard disk it may re-use the same pagefile.sys file, if there is not, let\u0027s say it is a all Linux machine the OS will probably reside on a EXT2/3/4 filesystem and the PE won\u0027t acces it at all, if the filesystem on the Hard Disk needs to be accessible to the PE (to save the downloaded files) then it\u0027s just a matter to configure properly the buiild.\n\nThe issue #3 is in fact the most relevant. a system using even partially the CD/DVD as \"boot/system\" volume will be slow as molasses.\n\nSo the point is making a system running entirely in RAM (and of course you need enough RAM to do that.\n\nTo be clear, once booted, you should be able to eject the CD/DVD and the system would still be fully functional.\n\nAnd the initial loading will be anyway slow-slow, using a USB device (such as a stick/pendrive) will already be faster (and once fully loaded, a Ram based system will be blazingly fast).\n\n![:cheers:](https://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif)\n\nWonko\n\n"
