      "content": "We are still at square #1.  \n\nThe fact that 99.99% of OEM\u0027s do install XP on the First (and often ONLY) active partition on the disk (thus making the SAME partition BOTH \"System\" and \"Boot\" one) and the fact that the NT/2K/XP install does not provide an intuitive way to create partitions, DOES NOT mean that it is the right thing to do.  \n\nThe concept of having a SEPARATE **system** partition from the **boot** one, is made particularly difficult to grasp by people that have not \"historical\" experience with NT based systems in dual booting with good ol\u0027 MS-DOS by the good guys at MS, that besides MANY other things, managed to MESS copletely the names attributed to them (read here):  \n[http://www.multiboot....uk/system.html](http://www.multibooters.co.uk/system.html \"External link\")  \n\nI will use the ***right*** terms (exactly VICEVERSA to the ones the MS guys use):  \n\n* **Boot** is the partition that is **boot**ed by the MBR (normally the Active Primary)\n* **System** is the whatever partition that holds the given Operating **System**\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nIt is not difficult at all, once you get the hang of it, NT based systems, UNLIKE DOS based ones, were DESIGNED to be RUN from Logical Volumes inside extended, this is one of the reasons why BOOT.INI and ARCPATHS were introduced.  \n\nThe typical status of a PC at the time was that of having a DOS (usually MS-DOS 5.0÷6.22) AND to it a NT (3.5 or 4.0) was ADDED, normally the PC would have a single (smallish hard disk drive - tiny for today\u0027s \"standards\" - possibly very BIG for the \"standards\" of the time, like 300÷500 Mbytes! ) normally (as ALL hard disk SHOULD be) partitioned in one single Primary partition and one Extended Partition containing several Logical Volumes or, maybe, filled up to the brim by the DOS apps and DATA, and an additional hard disk was used.  \n\nInitially there were NO tools like \"Partition Magic\", so the good guys at MS devised a rather simple trick, \"divide\" the OS in such a way that most (99.99% of it) could be installed on ANY partition (no matter if Primary or Logical Volume inside Extended or on which disk), with the ONLY limitation that the 0.01%, and namely the files:  \n\n* NTLDR\n* NTDETECT.COM\n* BOOT.INI\n* NTBOOTDD.SYS (optional, only used for SCSI hard disks - or - to be correct - for NON-IDE HD\u0027s)\n\nNEEDed to actually be on the First Active Primary partition (the one that had DOS).  \n\nRemember also how NT 4.00 could use BOTH FAT16 and NTFS partitions (the latter being the advised filesystem for the System partition), whilst DOS could ONLY boot and access FAT16 partitions.  \n\nNow, take your time, and besides the given link to multibooters, read also:  \n[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/102873](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/102873 \"External link\")  \n[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTLDR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTLDR \"External link\")  \n[http://www.winimage.com/bootpart.htm](http://www.winimage.com/bootpart.htm \"External link\")  \n\nQuick sum up:  \nNormal Operation:  \n\"Standard\" MBR-\\\u003eBootsector of Active Primary partition invoking NTLDR-\\\u003eNTLDR on SAME partition-\\\u003e BOOT.INI on SAME partition-\\\u003eNTDETECT.COM on SAME partition-\\\u003e NT install on WHATEVER partition mapped in BOOT.INI and chosen (NO MATTER on WHICH disk)  \n\nIndirect method one:  \n\"special\" MBR (bootloader)-\\\u003eBootsector of WHATEVER partition invoking NTLDR (if Logical Volume with the manual correction of \"sectors before\")-\\\u003eNTLDR on SAME partition-\\\u003e BOOT.INI on SAME partition-\\\u003eNTDETECT.COM on SAME partition-\\\u003e NT install on WHATEVER partition mapped in BOOT.INI and chosen (BUT the partition on which NTLDR is MUST be on FIRST disk)  \n\nGrub4dos (or Syslinux) DIRECT chainloading  \n\"special\" MBR (or ANY other way to invoke grub4dos or syslinux)-\\\u003eNTLDR on WHATEVER partition-\\\u003e BOOT.INI on SAME partition-\\\u003eNTDETECT.COM on SAME partition-\\\u003e NT install on WHATEVER partition mapped in BOOT.INI and chosen (BUT the partition on which NTLDR is MUST be on FIRST disk)  \n\nBeside any other consideration, there are reasons why installing NT on a non-at-the-beginning partition, and more exactly on a Logical Volume inside Extended, is (statistically) SAFER:  \n[http://www.msfn.org/...showtopic\u003d33964](http://www.msfn.org/board/index.php?showtopic\u003d33964 \"External link\")  \n[http://www.msfn.org/...opic\u003d33964\\\u0026st\u003d6](http://www.msfn.org/board/index.php?showtopic\u003d33964\u0026st\u003d6 \"External link\")  \n\nCircular back to Dan\u0027s site :wink::  \n[http://74.125.77.132...G...\u003dit\\\u0026ct\u003dclnk](http://74.125.77.132/search?q\u003dcache:NBbVSGvnUWYJ:ericleite.com/tag/partitions/+/search%3Fhl%3Dit%26client%3Dopera%26hs%3DdiV%26rls%3Dit%26q%3Dhttp://ericleite.com/%2Bsite:ericleite.com%2B\u0026cd\u003d5\u0026hl\u003dit\u0026ct\u003dclnk \"External link\")  \n\n:wink:  \nWonko   \n"

With Linux you are able to install a fully independent and stand alone OS directly to a logical partition or to a second or higher hard drive, because the Linux IPL is clever enough to be able to pass control to that OS. Unfortunately Microsoft have never introduced such abilities in their IPL and so have never seen the need to allow you to do a fully independent install of Windows to a logical partition or other drive. Their IPL can only work with primary partitions on its own boot hard drive, so if you want to install to anything other than one of these primaries then you can only do it by allowing a boot drive primary to become a system partition where ntldr or bootmgr will operate as a bootmanager. The Windows setup will simply refuse to continue if there is not a suitable boot drive primary that it can use.\"*\n\n"

) normally (as ALL hard disk SHOULD be) partitioned in one single Primary partition and one Extended Partition containing several Logical Volumes or, maybe, filled up to the brim by the DOS apps and DATA, and an additional hard disk was used.  \n\nInitially there were NO tools like \"Partition Magic\", so the good guys at MS devised a rather simple trick, \"divide\" the OS in such a way that most (99.99% of it) could be installed on ANY partition (no matter if Primary or Logical Volume inside Extended or on which disk), with the ONLY limitation that the 0.01%, and namely the files:  \n\n* NTLDR\n* NTDETECT.COM\n* BOOT.INI\n* NTBOOTDD.SYS (optional, only used for SCSI hard disks - or - to be correct - for NON-IDE HD\u0027s)\n\nNEEDed to actually be on the First Active Primary partition (the one that had DOS).  \n\nRemember also how NT 4.00 could use BOTH FAT16 and NTFS partitions (the latter being the advised filesystem for the System partition), whilst DOS could ONLY boot and access FAT16 partitions.  \n\nNow, take your time, and besides the given link to multibooters, read also:  \n[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/102873](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/102873 \"External link\")  \n[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTLDR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTLDR \"External link\")  \n[http://www.winimage.com/bootpart.htm](http://www.winimage.com/bootpart.htm \"External link\")  \n\nQuick sum up:  \nNormal Operation:  \n\"Standard\" MBR-\\\u003eBootsector of Active Primary partition invoking NTLDR-\\\u003eNTLDR on SAME partition-\\\u003e BOOT.INI on SAME partition-\\\u003eNTDETECT.COM on SAME partition-\\\u003e NT install on WHATEVER partition mapped in BOOT.INI and chosen (NO MATTER on WHICH disk)  \n\nIndirect method one:  \n\"special\" MBR (bootloader)-\\\u003eBootsector of WHATEVER partition invoking NTLDR (if Logical Volume with the manual correction of \"sectors before\")-\\\u003eNTLDR on SAME partition-\\\u003e BOOT.INI on SAME partition-\\\u003eNTDETECT.COM on SAME partition-\\\u003e NT install on WHATEVER partition mapped in BOOT.INI and chosen (BUT the partition on which NTLDR is MUST be on FIRST disk)  \n\nGrub4dos (or Syslinux) DIRECT chainloading  \n\"special\" MBR (or ANY other way to invoke grub4dos or syslinux)-\\\u003eNTLDR on WHATEVER partition-\\\u003e BOOT.INI on SAME partition-\\\u003eNTDETECT.COM on SAME partition-\\\u003e NT install on WHATEVER partition mapped in BOOT.INI and chosen (BUT the partition on which NTLDR is MUST be on FIRST disk)  \n\nBeside any other consideration, there are reasons why installing NT on a non-at-the-beginning partition, and more exactly on a Logical Volume inside Extended, is (statistically) SAFER:  \n[http://www.msfn.org/...showtopic\u003d33964](http://www.msfn.org/board/index.php?showtopic\u003d33964 \"External link\")  \n[http://www.msfn.org/...opic\u003d33964\\\u0026st\u003d6](http://www.msfn.org/board/index.php?showtopic\u003d33964\u0026st\u003d6 \"External link\")  \n\nCircular back to Dan\u0027s site :wink::  \n[http://74.125.77.132...G...\u003dit\\\u0026ct\u003dclnk](http://74.125.77.132/search?q\u003dcache:NBbVSGvnUWYJ:ericleite.com/tag/partitions/+/search%3Fhl%3Dit%26client%3Dopera%26hs%3DdiV%26rls%3Dit%26q%3Dhttp://ericleite.com/%2Bsite:ericleite.com%2B\u0026cd\u003d5\u0026hl\u003dit\u0026ct\u003dclnk \"External link\")  \n\n:wink:  \nWonko   \n"

Their IPL can only work with primary partitions on its own boot hard drive, so if you want to install to anything other than one of these primaries then you can only do it by allowing a boot drive primary to become a system partition where ntldr or bootmgr will operate as a bootmanager.

(Okay, maybe there\u0027s technically a \"boot sector\", but it\u0027s normally blank unless we put an OS there.) If we put an OS and boot record there we need to check the boot record to make sure it knows where to find itself. Petr Soucek has documented that a key parameter in the partition boot sector may prevent an OS from booting from an extended logical partition. This parameter, \"Hidden Sectors\", should be the total number of sectors on the disk preceding the partition, but for a logical partition the value may be incorrectly initialized by the tool used to create or manipulate the partition. Sometimes it is the number of sectors from the start of the extended partition (e.g., 63) instead of from the beginning of the disk. If this number is incorrect the OS cannot determine where the other sectors of its own partition are and the boot process hangs. Powerquest\u0027s Partition Table Editor may be used to fix the \"Hidden Sectors\" parameter in the partition boot record of any OS\u0027s installed in logical partitions. Partition boot records in primary partitions are normally okay\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n[http://www.goodells....boot/ptedit.htm](http://www.goodells.net/multiboot/ptedit.htm \"External link\")  \n\ngrub4dos can fix the Sectors before without need of PTEDIT or a similar tool, by using the partnew command (a free entry in the PT of MBR is needed, or you need a more complex workaround) or use the map --in-situ command to TEMPORARILY fix the problem.  \n\n![:thumbsup:](https://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/thumbsup.gif)  \nWonko   \n"

(but you still need to \"tell it\" to do the fixes ![:thumbsup:](https://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/thumbsup.gif)).  \n\nIf, instead of using chainloader (hd0,x)+1 you use chainloader (hd0,x)/ntldr, the bootsector code can be whatever (or even be completely missing).  \n\nTo correct the \"sectors before\" there are TWO methods:  \n\n* Using the partnew command:  \n\n  If you have an empty partition entry in the main MBR (as you should have) you can use partnew to create a new primary partition entry pointing to the logical volume inside extended, during this process the \"sectors before\" will be automatically and PERMANENTLY corrected .  \n  Example, say you have a logical NTFS partition that you want to boot (hd0,5) and an empty partition entry in the main MBR (hd0,3):  \n\n  ```\n  partnew \u0026#40;hd0,3\u0026#41; 0x07 \u0026#40;hd0,5\u0026#41;+1\n  ```\n\n  this will create an entry in last entry of the main MBR and correct the \"sectors before\" in the partition bootsector automatically and PERMANENTLY.  \n  Then you can:  \n\n  ```\n  root \u0026#40;hd0,3\u0026#41;\n\n  chainloader /ntldr\n\n  boot\n  ```\n\n  to boot or:  \n\n  ```\n  partnew \u0026#40;hd0,3\u0026#41; 0 0 0\n  ```\n\n  reset the empty entry and chainload normally the logical volume  \n\n  ```\n  root \u0026#40;hd0,5\u0026#41;\n\n  chainloader /ntldr\n\n  boot\n  ```\n\n* Using the map --in-situ command, create a TEMPORARY fix:  \n\n  ```\n  map --in-situ \u0026#40;hd0,5\u0026#41;+1 \u0026#40;hd0\u0026#41;\n\n  root \u0026#40;hd0,5\u0026#41;\n\n  chainloader /ntldr\n\n  boot\n  ```\n\n  this will correct the \"sectors before\" in the partition bootsector automatically and TEMPORARILY.\n\nthis latter method is extremely convenient as it doesn\u0027t \"touch\" anything, and you can boot from a logical volume \"on-the-fly\", this is what I meant, when I said you don\u0027t need to correct the values if using grub4dos....  \n\n![:cheers:](https://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif)  \nWonko   \n"

      "content": "Hi,   \n\nSorry for responding late -- you can tell from my posts in other forums that I was busy. Let me first explain what took me so long, before getting into \"business\".   \n\nWhen trying the following out, almost everything failed on me and I had almost retreated to the \"stone-age\" to get things going.   \n\nI attempted 2 types of windows install, ghost restore and direct windows install, each having 2 or more different CDs. BTW, you\u0027ve got to be a Chinese in order to understand why there are so many ways to install windows instead of just one, the official one. FYI, just to proof that I am not lying, :-), I\u0027ve been trying, \"GHOST XP SP3 2010 V2.0 统一纯净版\", which has been working for me fine before, then \"GHOST XP SP3 2010 V2.1统一会员纯净版\", when all these ghost restore didn\u0027t work, I reverted to direct windows install, using \"WinXP SP3 2009 v1.3精简安装版（220MB)\", then \"深度 Windows XP SP3完美精简 V6.2版\\[215M小盘\\]\" produced in 2008年6月13日, then \"Windows XP Professional and Retail All-in-one SP3\". Nothing worked. All crashed with blue screen saying something like plug and play driver error.   \n\nThis is not only tested on a single machine, but two entirely different ones. All get the same result. Only when I reverted to \"Win2K Professional (SP4, RU1-V2)\" when I was finally able to see windows installation finished to the end.   \n\nMeanwhile, my USB Linux boot failed on me as well, and even booting primary windows partition using grub4dos failed on me too! So I reverted booting grub4dos from USB back to CDROM. Then things started to move forward. Moreover, I\u0027ve repartitioned my HD just to test out the following word for word.  \n\nAll I want to say is that I\u0027ve met with tremendous difficulties, but all solved by myself, but not the following:  \n\n\u003e To correct the \"sectors before\" there are TWO methods:  \n\u003e \\[list\u003d1\\]  \n\u003e \\[\\*\\]Using the partnew command:  \n\u003e\n\u003e If you have an empty partition entry in the main MBR (as you should have) you can use partnew to create a new primary partition entry pointing to the logical volume inside extended, during this process the \"sectors before\" will be automatically and PERMANENTLY corrected .  \n\u003e Example, say you have a logical NTFS partition that you want to boot (hd0,5) and an empty partition entry in the main MBR (hd0,3):  \n\u003e\n\u003e ```\n\u003e partnew \u0026#40;hd0,3\u0026#41; 0x07 \u0026#40;hd0,5\u0026#41;+1\n\u003e ```\n\u003e\n\u003e this will create an entry in last entry of the main MBR and correct the \"sectors before\" in the partition bootsector automatically and PERMANENTLY.  \n\u003e Then you can:  \n\u003e\n\u003e ```\n\u003e root \u0026#40;hd0,3\u0026#41;\n\u003e\n\u003e chainloader /ntldr\n\u003e\n\u003e boot\n\u003e ```\n\u003e\n\u003e to boot or:  \n\u003e\n\u003e ```\n\u003e partnew \u0026#40;hd0,3\u0026#41; 0 0 0\n\u003e ```\n\u003e\n\u003e reset the empty entry and chainload normally the logical volume  \n\u003e\n\u003e ```\n\u003e root \u0026#40;hd0,5\u0026#41;\n\u003e\n\u003e chainloader /ntldr\n\u003e\n\u003e boot\n\u003e ```\n\u003e\n\u003e \u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nBeen there, done that, word for word.
