      "content": "Hi all\n\nI apologise if this has already been covered on another thread however I was unable to locate it. At present I have created a bootable USB drive which contains 6 different versions of Windows 7, using the following tutorial:\n\n[02 - How to create a USB drive that will install one of many choices of Windows OS\u0027s (Vista/Win7/Server 2008/XP) - RMPrepUSB](http://www.rmprepusb.com/tutorials/how-to-create-a-usb-drive-that-will-install-vista-win7-and-server-2008 \"External link\")\n\nWhat I would like to do is add Windows 8 Installation sources to the Drive in the same manner. I don\u0027t want to use the new method which uses iso\u0027s. If I have to create another partition to accomodate this then that is fine.\n\nIs anyone able to help?\n\n"
