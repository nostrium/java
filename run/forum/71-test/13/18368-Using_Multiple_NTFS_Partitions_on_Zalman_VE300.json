Is the in-active partition seen as a second CD ?\n\n\u003e Another question, perhaps stupid, but can I load *both* NTFS and FAT firmware?

      "content": "@ TheArtfulDodger,  \n\nas promised, I am here again to respond your questions. I tried to post yesterday, but the site did not work well.  \n\nFirstly, I beg your pardon for having made some mess in one of my first post above (when I said to have successfully booted Macrium Reflect in dual-mode).  \nEffectively this result was true, but booting with another WinPE iso.  \n\nSorry again for the inconvenience, though.  \n\nNow, after having made (in a much more neat way) some more experimentation (staying always in dual-mode) with different WinPE-based and Linux-based ISOs, I can say :  \n\n- Macrium Reflect (I have the version 5.0.5154_64 bit) gave the same your results (that is, inactive partition no visible), so I think it was not the best choice for making these type of tests with Zalman device  \n- More importantly, booting other WinPEs (or Linux-based) ISOs, the results were good, giving a full visibility of the inactive partition  \n\nThis means that, probably, seeing/accessing or not all the Zalman partitions will depend on how the WinPE iso was created.  \n\nRegarding the last your question about \"cloning your system SSD\", please make a search in the forum; you should find some interesting and useful posts/advices (from Wonko The Sane) about (Dos, Win or Linux-based) free tools.\n\nPersonally, I do prefer to use reliable products for this \"***delicate***\" task (for example, the commercial products from Terabyte -BIBM or Image for Dos/Windows/Linux).  \n\n++**Anyway, before going to decide the right tool for you, please move with caution along these paths !!!!**++\n\n++**I do hope you\u0027ll going to better clarify your ideas/targets, gaining some more knowledge on the topic of cloning/imaging/backing-up, before to proceed.**++   \n\nambralivio\n\n"

Thanks go out to all who passed on valuable information to me and I thought it only right to pass on what I\u0027ve learned to the forum.\n\nI read (and tried to digest) the material suggested by everyone plus some that I turned up accidentally myself. I kept coming back to two things that Ambralivio mentioned (probably in passing): \"When booting Macrium Reflect\" and \"booting with another WinPE iso\".\n\nSo, I wondered if, instead of Macrium being the problem, perhaps WinPE might be the culprit! So, I decided to boot the Macrium Reflect (Free) Rescue iso, from the Zalman again, but this time connected to a USB2.0 port. Lo and behold, but now Macrium worked properly, showing both the CD and the HDD partition!\n\nSo, now I needed to fix the WinPE. After doing more reading, I decided the easiest thing to try was to go out and get WinPE 4.0. That meant getting Windows Assessment \\\u0026 Deployment Kit, which I did. After installing it, I located the new WinPE.wim \\[Assessment \\\u0026 Deployment Kit\\\\Windows Preinstallation Environment\\\\amd64\\\\en-us\\\\winpe.wim\\]. Having this, I plugged it into the Macrium Wizard (Rebuild the environment...) and used this new winpe.wim as the custom base wim. That\u0027s all there was to it!\n\nSo, now it works like I wanted it to do lo these many weeks ago. My sincere thanks to all that provided assistance. I hope this might help someone else in the same (or similar) boat!
