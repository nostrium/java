Select one of the ISOs that gives the error and press **p** then enter the password easy2boot and then press **e** to see what the menu for that iso looks like.\n\nIf it looks OK, report what error message you see (normally a command line is printed as well as the error message).\n\nAlso type **displaymem**in the grub4dos console and see what you get - is there a hole in memory anywhere?\n\nIf you choose a simple ISO (e.g. dsl) then maybe you could try typing in the commands one at a time?\n\n"
