      "content": "Hi !\n\nOK so here the thing.\n\nI have a SONY 13,3\u0027 LAPTOP , and**two hard drives (2\\* SSD)** , one is on the regular HDD slot \\\u003e we will call it main OS (1\\* Samsung 840 256GB) and one is on the ODD-Bay slot \\\u003e we will call it secondary ssd (replaced dvd drive with caddy).\n\nI need to ***setup a dual boot for work***, and for some security reason (integrity of main system etc) , doing pentest on the second OS.\n\nThe++BIOS++ *doesnt detect the secondary SSD in the ODD bay* , seem like a bios lock or a lack, but **the hard drive is detected without problem after one OS as boot (in windows i see it a secondary hard drive, can setup partition like i need to) and linux same.**\n\nAfter a lot of search arround, i have only find 2 way to boot on it\n\n1 -/ Boot on the main OS (hard drive 1\\*) with vmware/or virtualbox using physical hard drive option\n\n2 -/ Create linux stick with vmware/virtualbox to boot it (same as 1/ but with usb stick, no vmware install on the main os)\n\nBut i loose lot of performence by the way and GPU perf too (have geforce 640LE, usefull..)\n\n*So, can i made my second ssd bootable with VHD, or with a alternative boot manager ? (Like GRUB4DOS ..)*\n\n*for example, can i put one VHD with all i need on the ssd, then made a sample script (in a 4GB small usb stick) for launch the booting sequence and boot the VHD on the ssd ?*\n\nThanks for any help ![:idea:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/idea.gif) !\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n"

I have switched them for do the install.\n\nNote : The secondary SSD is detected with the Xubuntu installer for example (when its scan hard drive and need to choose wich one you install the OS)\n\nIts detected by windows installer too, but marked as not bootable\n\n**Edited by NyanNINI75, 02 May 2013 - 08:43 PM.**\n"

([http://reboot.pro/to...st-version-302/](http://reboot.pro/topic/6851-project-pwboot-latest-version-302/ \"\"))\n\nSo i will clear the process and test it munday\n\n1 -/ Made windows7 VHD tru PWBoot\n\n2 -/ Clean main harddrive, install windows 8 pro\n\n3 -/ Install easyBCDEditor, add entry for the windows7 VHD on the secondary SSD\n\n4 -/ Press F8 at boot for go windows 8 boot-menu, select the VHD and install all drivers and shits\n\nQ : Did you recommand to do a full space VHD, mean my secondary ssd is 128GB , you recommand i put a 120GB VHD for example ?\n\nQ2 : What properties i put for the secondary ssd as drive, NTFS primary ?\n\nQ3 : I mind about Full disk encryption of the VHD os after booting in, by truecrypt, have checked on google and seem OK, i have already do it on a Vmware disk for example (vm), in fact VHD are virtual-disk file, like VDI or vmdk so i think its will work no ?\n\n**Edited by NyanNINI75, 04 May 2013 - 03:16 PM.**\n"
