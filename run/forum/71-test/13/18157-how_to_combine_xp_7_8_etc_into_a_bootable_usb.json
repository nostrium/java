I think that it is syslinux !syslinux used by sardu can boot the only systeme(bartpe or win7pe) Added in the first one! When I add bartpe in first time, bartpe work, but not win7pe!and vice-versa! Then I create 4 partition on my usb 8go, the 2nd with bartpe,slax, the 3th partition win7pe, and in the 4th partition:konboot,hdd regenerator, partition table doctor.! I don\u0027t know to setup a bootloader for all partition,then I use partition manager to boot The partition which I want to use. I don\u0027t use xboot because it doesn\u0027t allow to boot in other partition(2nd,3th...) bartpe with cfadisk   \n"

Or in a single partition, There is only one syslinux to use to start booting bartpe and the win7pe . Thus, when I add win7pe first, it work fine, but bartpe don\u0027t boot.Because sardu use syslinux 4. And when I add bartpe first, it work fine, but win7pe don\u0027t boot.Because sardu use syslinux 3.
