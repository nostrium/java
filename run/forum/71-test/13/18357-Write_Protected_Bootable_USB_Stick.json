(Given that it runs fine from CD!)\n\nTried that, but it did not help. After some testing I am almost convinced that when write protection switch is beeing turned on, flash stick is not beeing detected as bootable. The whole detection procedure is skipped and it starts from HDD just like my flash drive would be normal storage device. Of course it boots from that flash when I set it to writeable mode.\n\n\u003e You need to be more specific, provide some detailed report of the hardware and setup involved, etc., etc....\n\nI have tried this on 4 PC\u0027s, each of different era, with probably every BIOS setting and the problem is persistent. Stick details: PQI 4GB USB 2.0 model: U339.\n\nOS is custom nix version that is normally used as Live CD with option to use it as Live USB.\n\n\u003e More seriously, what you described is a \"vague\" limitless superOS capable of doing \\*anything\\* on \\*any\\* hardware.  \n\u003e\n\u003e Are you thinking of a Linux distro or about a PE?  \n\u003e Both can do ***some*** of that, probably ***most*** of that, but you cannot realistically expect to find such a \"wide use\" multi-tool, additionally fitting in less than 2 Gb.\n\nROFL\n\nBasically I want as small as possible, as fast as possible, as realiable as possible linux based distro that can be used as both secondary OS and recovery tool for NTFS Windows machines. Hence, it needs drivers to boot properly into various kinds of machines and needs to have ability to operate on NTFS drives. Also I want it to load and configure network and printer drivers by itself. Then just basic office software, browser, pdf-reader, calculator, etc. I don\u0027t think that its that much, IMO almost any distro offers that. What I need is \"out of box\" solution, easy to set, easy to use(for somebody who is only familiar with Windows) but also fast, tested and realiable.\n\nOf course multiboot is always option, and in fact I might be trying to load few compact distros at once, in case of one or another failing on some system, so that\u0027s why I am space limited, but since the smallest stick I own is 4GB, there should be plenty space for everything.\n\n**Edited by popov, 24 March 2013 - 02:03 AM.**\n"

      "content": "Yes, that\u0027s the one I\u0027m using. Under Windows XP I have installed LPS(lightweight portable security) with their own installer that automatically formatted device. There is no bootloader, it\u0027s the only thing that is on the stick.\n\nAnd yes, the stick itself stinks, I am using it just because of the switch. I would get something better, but it seems that write protected drives are very rare these days.\n\nAnother thing, I will be making multiboot flash stick(different than one above), and I am wondering what to use to format and build everything. It will be made (preferably) under Windows XP, and will have one main distro(with its own write storage, like Mint), small fast-launching distro for browsing net(like xPUD but recent), some basic diagnostic and recovery tools for both WinXP and Win7 and all that standard HDD/Memory/etc tools that are there on recovery CD\u0027s. I could even add MS-DOS, PicoXP and such just for fun, but the thing needs to start rolling first. As for now, I am somehow stuck.\n\nThe point is, some distros need to be installed in much different way than others, which complicates everything. This is especially true for all those distros that come with their own installers, like Slax. So I\u0027d like to ask for a preffered tool, which could do it.\n\n**Edited by popov, 24 March 2013 - 09:14 PM.**\n"

It was a cheap plastic one.\n\nI agree about the speed, however this is because most of these card readers are very cheap. If you buy a USB 3.0 card reader (which I don\u0027t have and so have not tested - e.g. Kingston do one) then speed should not be an issue as these have good (fast) controllers. Of course, SD cards vary in speed a lot so you need a good fast one too.\n\nInterestingly, on wiki it says\n\n\u003e A host device can lock an SD card using a password of up to 16 bytes, typically supplied by the user. A locked card interacts normally with the host device except that it rejects commands to read and write data. A locked card can be unlocked only by providing the same password. The host device can, after supplying the old password, specify a new password or disable locking. Without the password (typically, in the case that the user forgets the password), the host device can command the card to erase all the data on the card for future re-use (except card data under DRM), but there is no way to gain access to the existing data.\n\nI wonder if any s/w exists which will do this?\n\n"

I also boot my ASUS Netbook using a write locked SDHC card; however, as discussed in this thread there is a possiblity that the write lock could be defeated. I am currently using Puppy Precise version 5.4.3 which is based on Ubuntu 12.04.\n\nRegards, Ron\n\n\u003e Hey there,\n\u003e\n\u003e is there any way of making USB stick bootable when it is write protected(by switch)? I have several sticks and tried several OS\u0027es on them, but they all fail to boot when i write-protect my pendrive, while working perfectly fine when the drive is unlocked. It seems kinda awkward, when compared to bootable live CD\u0027s, which do not require to write anything.\n\u003e\n\u003e The second thing I want to ask about - I am looking for a fast, small (max 2GB) bootable distro that will boot and work on as many computers as possible, ie. probably having lots of preinstalled drivers. It needs to automatically detect and config simple network, must have r/w access to NTFS drives, ability to detect printers, internet browser, office, and some basic tools. And it should be easy enough for pure-windows person to use it as OS/data backup.\n\n"

But of course you are correct, because I had other flash drives and it sometimes randomly blacks out on them too. Still it doesn\u0027t explain that I had like 10 in a row while testing one of those files.\n\n\u003e It seems your BIOS is determined to treat the USB as a floppy in r-mode - but why?

It could be some defect with their mobos, not sure, but the way they fixed it was making it emulate USB-HDD with USB-FDD, so in fact it was using USB-FDD driver to read USB-HDD disks. If it\u0027s true, then probably it\u0027s hardcoded in BIOS and nothing can be done about it. Unconfimed.\n\nP5GC-MX is cheap limited mobo that also does not offer anything near real experience. I never saw poorer BIOS before, literary there\u0027s nothing inside. There is no way of choosing USB-HDD/FDD/ZIP/etc simply, because there is just one single USB option.\n\nSadly I don\u0027t have access to P5GC-MX right now, but I can test it on MSI 870A-G54, which full recent mobo with latest drivers. Just don\u0027t have much time atm. Cheers.\n\n**Edited by popov, 01 April 2013 - 05:00 PM.**\n"

The most interesting information (in my opinion) within was actually when the thread was temporarily derailed into a somewhat off-topic discussion on the efficacy (and apparent lack thereof) of SD card write-protect switches. You can find most of that on page 2, I believe. But from the point that Popov redirects the discussion into troubleshooting his own 4GB USB flash stick write-protected boot issues this summary should do:\n\n1) By means of various (and later exhaustive) imaging tests, it\u0027s established pretty early on that Popov\u0027s USB stick is either a flawed model or is individually defective in that his write-protect switch also fundamentally changes the read mode of the device to (apparently imperfectly) emulate a floppy. Time and again regardless of hardware or software platform Popov doggedly returns test results to indicate that his USB stick a ) successfully boots with the switch set to off but b ) fails to boot with the switch set to on.\n\n2) Possibly motivated by some combination of sadomasochism and/or scholarly interest, Wonko and MedEvil continue to encourage Popov in his misguided efforts by suggesting test after redundant imaging test until they finally devolve into what appears to be the the tail-end of an argument (probably begun elsewhere) between themselves on the merits of the plop bootloader USB driver. While Wonko is apparently for it and MedEvil against, neither offers any especially supportive evidence to back their positions.\n\n3) After plainly and repeatedly demonstrating a fundamental lack of subject-matter understanding, in the course of testing Popov finally mistakenly destroys his hard-disk partition table and expresses very understandable concerns over valuable personal data loss. Nevertheless undaunted and evidently equipped with much more free time than purchasing power (or common sense), when we last hear from Popov he is considering replacing his laptop\u0027s BIOS firmware with the extremely experimental and almost certainly unsupported open-source CoreBoot project.\n\n4) Considering Popov\u0027s boundless (and witless) determination up to that point, we can assume that we haven\u0027t heard from Popov for three weeks now because he actually did attempt to replace his manufacturer\u0027s BIOS with CoreBoot, failed miserably in said attempt, and can therefore no longer boot at all let-alone access the internet to apprise us of the situation regardless of his 4GB USB flash drive\u0027s write-protect switch setting.\n\nWow.\n\nStill, just in case I\u0027m not too late and Popov still is out there somewhere, I have this advice to offer him:\n\nTroubleshooting should result in an economical solution, not more problems. Remember Occam\u0027s razor and always start your troubleshooting with evaluating and/or replacing those components that are most obviously related to your issue and that are cheapest/easiest to replace/evaluate.\n\nPopov, don\u0027t flash over your BIOS with CoreBoot to solve a problem with your USB stick. Instead, consider booting with the switch set to \"off,\" or even, just maybe, try another USB stick. Seriously, I\u0027m astounded that throughout 5 pages of forum posts and test after redundant test, no one once suggested this. At some point, Popov, you\u0027ve just gotta cut your losses; know when to fold \u0027em, as it were.\n\nHappy Hunting!\n\n**Edited by mikeserv, 05 May 2013 - 02:01 AM.**\n"
