BIOS (either \"absolute\" like a limitation of some kind in it or \"relative\" like settings in it)\n2. Disk (the actual disk drive and the time it needs to be ready if powered by the same PC that is booting)\n3. Disk enclosure ( the controller in it having some limitation, again either \"absolute\" or \"relative\" )\n\nSo, if you have another USB hard disk is good to try it, but no need to re-do the NT 6.x fast installer, the last few simple steps of partitioning/formatting/copying BOOTMGR are faster and more than enough.\n\nIf you have a USB stick, it would be another thing to test, in which case you could use RMPREPUSB to partition/format it (all data on it will be deleted, so only do it if you have a \"spare\" USB stick or image it before doing the test).\n\nCheck also my everyday more outdated page, FAQ #10 is still essentially valid (especially on oldish hardware):\n\n[http://jaclaz.alterv...SB/USBfaqs.html](http://jaclaz.altervista.org/Projects/USB/USBfaqs.html \"External link\")\n\n![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif)\n\nWonko\n\n"
