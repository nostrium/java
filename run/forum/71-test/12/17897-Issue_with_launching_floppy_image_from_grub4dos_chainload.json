      "content": "I have a .img floppy image - Eurosoft\u0027s Pc-Check Hardware Diagnostics Program.\n\nI am using SARDU to create a mulitboot DVD and want to add the above program to the main menu.\n\nI have tried using MEMDISK to launch the floppy but for some reason the image wont boot for the program to launch. I know that my code in the .cfg is correct as I can launch other .img files successfully.\n\nSo... I tried making a grub4dos USB build to launch the floppy image and it works :-)\n\nBut for my purposes I need to use a DVD so I have tried to chainload grub4dos from the isolinux.cfg\n\nMy isolinux.cfg file reads:\n\n\u003e LABEL pccheck  \n\u003e MENU LABEL pccheck  \n\u003e BOOT /grldr\n\nI have copied the grldr, menu.lst \\\u0026 floppy image files to the root folder of my DVD build\n\nMy menu.list file reads:\n\n\u003e title pccheck  \n\u003e find --set-root /pccheck.img  \n\u003e map /pccheck.img (fd0)  \n\u003e map --hook  \n\u003e chainloader (fd0)+1  \n\u003e rootnoverify (fd0)  \n\u003e map --floppies\u003d1\n\nI then built my ISO (to be burnt to DVD) and tested it in QEMU. The grub4dos menu chainloads successfully but when I attempt to launch the Pc-Check program the following error appears in QEMU:\n\n\u003e Booting pccheck\n\u003e\n\u003e find --set-root /pccheck.img\n\u003e\n\u003e Error: 15: File not found\n\u003e\n\u003e Press any key to continue...\n\nThis doesn\u0027t make any sense at all to me as the filepath is all correct. I have been reading grub4dos tutuorials and the syslinux.org tutorials for several hours trying to figure out why MEMDISK doesn\u0027t work and why my chainload isn\u0027t working either. I have tried my best to solve this myself but can\u0027t so I am hoping someone here can help me out please?\n\nEDIT: I intend to set the timeout on the menu.list to 0 so that the program will start automatically from the isolinux.cfg\n\n**Edited by TheFog, 16 December 2012 - 09:19 PM.**\n"

I didn\u0027t enable any of the default ISO\u0027s to be added to the SARDU build. However I did add an extra ISO from the \u0027Extra\u0027 menu \\\u003e Add Extra ISO (GRUB) so that when I built my ISO then grub.exe would be included in the final ISO build. It is irelevant what this \u0027Extra ISO\u0027 is as it\u0027s purpose is to simply add grub.exe to the final ISO build. From the built SARDU ISO I extracted all files.\n\nI then updated the isolinux.cfg file and copied into the folder my successful menu.lst file from the USB build that did work and also the PCCHECK.IMG floppy image.\n\nI then used ImgBurn to rebuild the ISO from the extracted SARDU ISO folder. From the Build menu I selected the default settings of:\n\nData Type: MODE1/2048\n\nFile System: ISO9660 + UDF (I have also tried ISO9660 + Joliet)\n\nFrom the Advanced \\\u003e Bootable Disc \\\u003e Options tab, I selected:\n\nMake Image Bootable (tickbox ticked)\n\nEmulation Type: None (Custom)\n\nBoot Image: %extracted ISO folder% \\\\ isolinux.bin\n\nPatch Boot Information Table (tickbox ticked)\n\n----\n\nOh, by the way, Steve I will be trying it to a burnt cd later to see if it works from there.\n\n**Edited by TheFog, 17 December 2012 - 06:16 PM.**\n"

With regards to the link my USB build works fine also, just won\u0027t work for an ISO.\n\nI burnt the ISO as Steve suggested in case it was an issue with QEMU and still no joy.\n\nI did an experiment and tried what Steve suggested and tried to run it straight from grub4dos instead of chainloading grub4dos from isolinux. Same problem ):\n\nI used HBCD customizer to extract the HBCD ISO. I then updated the menu.lst with my code and added the floopy image and then used the customizer to rebuild the ISO using grub4dos as bootloader.\n\n"
