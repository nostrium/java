      "content": "old Dell Laptop (circa 2005) boots from all USBHDD I have tried but only some USBFD. aprox 50% of the USBFD I have tried will not boot up and results in the \"error loading operating system\" message.  \n\nI have checked the bios version to see if an update is available but it is the most recent version.  \n\nthe same USBFD that do not boot in this Dell, do boot up in all other systems they have been tried in with the exception they do not boot in VMware player either, even when VMware player is ran on different host machines. it gives the same error message. other USBFD boot in VMware player fine though. (Im using plop to boot in VMs)  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nI have tried it with one partition and two partitions. always works fine except in VM and this Dell laptop.  \n\nI would like to learn how to view the boot sector and MBR with a hex editor to see what may be different if anything but Im not sure what I would be looking for here or if there would be any differences at all since I am using the exact same proceedures on all the USBFD  \n\nbasically I am using dsfok to zero out the USBFDs then XP on real hardware to initialize and format it NTFS, then copying everything to the USBFD. this has worked on countless hardware until this Dell and after that I discovered these same USBFD that are a problem in the Dell have the same problem in VMwarePlayer.  \n\nany clues or suggestions? thanks   \n"

      "content": "Both of you guys have provided us with really great \"multi-tools\" I did look into them some time ago and actually spent many hours trying to get IMG_XP working to no avail. its been a while and I forgot what was the sticking point now but I had just spent too much time there and had to move on, it will probably work without a hitch if I have a go again with it now but I must say that I learned a lot in that whole trouble shooting episode.  \n\nalong the way I was able to make my own universal XP image with bits an pieces from various people including both of you.  \n\nhowever, I would like to be able to read the boot sector so that I can see what is happening there. what I noticed about this situation after posting is that in the USBFD that is not working on Dell and VM, the USBFD name title has somehow been erased and it is now only named \"removable disc\" even though it has two partitions and I wonder if the title alone might be causing problems?  \n\nI will surely be using your tools again sometime when I have more time to devote to them. part of the difficulty in using them for me was that they had so many functions that were not clear as to what exactly they did. as an example.. what does this do, and why would that be needed? so for me there were too many functions and therfore too many chances for error (on my part). this greatly complicates things for me and so I look for a more direct and less automated way.  \n\nover a year had passed since Ive tried to use them so Im sure they have changed. I will have another look at them again before long anyway but as mentioned I sort of came up with my own round about ways that work most of the time. this is just where I am having trouble now, its not critical because I can just avoid using these certain USBFD for booting purposes.  \n\nthanks  \n\nedit: BTW Steve6375, I have not been able to use QEMU to boot USB directly, the only way I can get it to work is when I map it to the USB as a physical drive and then it is extreamly slow. I spent over 8 hours booting and adjusting my initial set up this way.. it was almost painful but it worked.  \n\n2nd edit: I just noticed RMBPrep has \"new\" QEMU included so I will check it out.  \n\nWimb, is your current multitool available here at reboot directly? mediafire and mirror you have wants me to jump through java scripting hoops for it.  \n\nthanks   \n"

      "content": "Steve6375, I dloaded the latest RMPrepUSB and it has done the trick for a couple of these USBFD for booting on this dell craptop but when I tried it on a USBHDD (it was booting in the dell and all others fine I just thought I would see how it does with RMPrepUSB) it finished up formating 2 partitions NTFS and I added the LBA then when I unplugged and repluged it in and went to check it out in mbrwiz it only showed \"disk\" in the partitions window of mbrwiz so then I went into XP drivemanagement and it couldnt connect, just a message \"still connecting\" but the computer started lagging badly to at the same time for some reason so I shut it off.  \n\nis RMPrepUSB for only flash drives? thankfully, I was able to bring back the USBHDD with the dsfok instructions I got from Wonko a few years ago.  \n\nWimb, YES Javascripting is indeed required on both of your download links, mediafire is useless for me with such a slow connection and the mirror didnt seem to work even when I enabled scripts so I ask again, is your current multitool available here at reboot directly?   \n\nthe last one I have is version #40 and I was only able to atain it from someone elses indirect link here at bootland at some point. I would give it another go but unless you can manage a more direct way of making it available for downloading I am not able.  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nother wierdness Ive found with this dell is when the USBHDD that was formated in XP (with driveguards help) is that if the internal HDD has no boot sector it wont boot an external USBHDD but it will boot a USBFDD!  \n\nif I remove the internal drive then it will boot an external USBHDD.. strange. I just got the latest plop to test with on this.  \n\nalso here to grab the latest grub4dos to put in the rmprepusb folder so I can experiment more with both.  \n\nIf I had a better connection I would download the latest ploplinux too but sadly it would take 9 hours for that , yeah very poor connection I have.  \n\nI\u0027ll post back later with more feedback from using rmprepusb as I try it with different hardware and stuff.   \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nthanks   \n"

Sometimes you need to Clean before you format as NTFS though as Windows tends to lock NTFS HDD partitions sometimes and RMPrep has trouble unlocking the volume. Can you try again using Clean and then Prepare Drive but just use 2PTNS option + NTFS?   \n"
