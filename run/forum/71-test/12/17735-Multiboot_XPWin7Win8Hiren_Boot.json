Just create a ei.cfg in the sources folder that contains 2 lines:  \n\n\\[Channel\\]  \nRetail  \n\nThen you will get a list of windows 8 versions to choose from ( assuming your install.wim contains multiple versions ). This is the opposite to win7 where you delete ei.cfg.  \n\nIf you need to run a program or batch file mount iso\u0027s or to ensure the USB drive is available prior to running setup.exe use winpeshl.ini \\[LaunchApps\\].  \n\nThe above ei.cfg works for me in both the run iso from USB and using multiple bcd files ( bc0, bc1 etc ) approach. I find that booting the recovery environment does not work correctly if run from a iso on a USB drive ( the recovery environment never finds a windows installation to recover ).  \n\nBig problem I have with running windows installs from USB is file size on fat32. Fully patched windows 7 / 8 x64 / 2012 isos exceed 4GB in size.  \n\n.   \n"
