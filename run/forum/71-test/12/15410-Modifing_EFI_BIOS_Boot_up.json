      "content": "I am new to this EFI BIOS concept and would really appreciate if anyone can help me out in resolving the below queries:  \n\n1 An simple example of how to use services (Boot/runtime) of EFI? i.e. what is the procedure of adding services/removing them? I have read the specs of EFI but I did not understand how we can use these APIs and use the services?  \n\n2 During the Boot up sequence in EFI BIOS, I would like to modify the value of a bit in the CMOS when a GPIO Interrupt occurs in the EFI code. It means, when a GPIO interrupt is encountered during boot up, I want to set/reset a bit in the CMOS. Can anyone suggest how to achive this in EFI BIOS. The interrupt handling and GPIO selection can be as per our convenience.  \n\n3 I would like to minimize the boot up time of EFI BIOS. Can anyone assist me how to minimize the boot up time of EFI. Suggestion can be anyway i.e. reducing services/modifying code/any other way? But I would like the know the procedure of how to do it via \"that way\" as I am new to this EFI concept.   \n"

      "content": "There are several special tools for EFI.  \nFor example the \"EFI shell\" which - as far as I know - allows you to manipulate memory directly and also has support for scripts (somewhat similar to batch).  \n\nJust google for \"EFI shell\". That might help you.   \n"

In recent testing using UEFI 2.3.1 hardware I achieved a \\~7 second OS boot to Windows 7 on an SSD. Actually I must complain about fast boot times, especially on Ultrabook... it seems impossible to invoke the F8 menu! ![:frusty:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/frusty.gif)   \n"
