Can I use say parition magic and cut 5gb or so into a secondary parition and host the windows installion files on that parition and boot that parition to reinstall windows on the main parition? This laptop is using windows vista I am wanting to install windows 8 via a secondary parition on the hard drive. Is this possible? The windows 8 installion I have does boot and even has a auto run but am I really able to boot to the secondary parition and install windows 8 over the vista installion?   \n"

Copy the contents of the Win8 DVD to the new 4GB partition  \n3. Install grub4dos onto the hard disk MBR (you can do this easily by downloading RMPrepUSB, hit Ctrl+F5 and then click on the **Install grub4dos** button - hit Enter when prompted to copy over the grldr file)  \n4.

Now type **find** to see what partitions you have - we need to boot from the 4GB partition - let us assume this is (hd0,3) (the 4th primary partition)  \n7. at the grub4dos prompt, type  \n**root (hd0,3)\nchainloader /bootmgr\nboot**   \n8. This should now boot to the Win 8 installer - enter the product key and choose Custom install - delete the other partitions (not the 4GB one!) and tell it to install to the empty space (you may need to create a new partition first?).  \n9. At some point BEFORE the install actually starts, hit the **SHIFT+F10** keys to get to a Win8 command prompt. Then type **bootsect /nt60 ALL /mbr** - this will replace the grub4dos bootloader with the normal bootmgr bootloader. Type **exit** and proceed with the install.  \n\nP.S.

HD0 would mean hard drive and the ,0 or ,1 is the partition? 0 being first partition which will be the one that I will reformat and install win 8 on and 1 is the partition which has the installion files on correct?  \nYes, I am assuming/guessing that the final ptn structure will be  \n\nhd0,0 Win8  \nhd0,1 4GB Setup files  \n\nWhat I am not sure about is if Win8 will also create a restore ptn if you delete all other partitions, in which case the setup files will be on (hd0,2) and the structure will be  \n\n(hd0,0) Win8 boot ptn  \n(hd0,1) Win8 System ptn  \n(hd0,2) 4GB Setup files   \n"

If the menu.lst does not work, just hit **c** to get to the grub4dos command shell and type in the commands manually.  \n\nP.S. that is why I, personally, prefer to install grub4dos.
