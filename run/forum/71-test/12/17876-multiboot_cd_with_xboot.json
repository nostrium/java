      "content": "I used rmprepusb to format usb drive to fat32/usb-hdd/syslinux. I then created multiboot cd from centos and debian iso images. I have noticed that xboot replaces the boot loader. Also, pressing boot button from qemu tab doesn\u0027t work. If I drag and drop iso, it works.\n\nInterestingly, enough... When I first installed the xboot software, I installed multiboot cd on a usb which contained hiren\u0027s cd. That worked. After formatting the cd using rmprepusb, it stopped working.\n\nMy os is windows 7 home premium edition.\n\nAny advice is appreciated.\n\nThanks in advance\n\n"
