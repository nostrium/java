It works very fine but not WLAN.  \nI used PENetwork-Tool, installed the T-Sinus 111 Card-Driver (PCMCIA) manually and find out how to get a connection to my router FritzBox7113 (Symbol appeared).  \nBut the Opera Browser does not work. (with LAN connection it works properly)  \nAnother problem: After hardware installation, system often crashes (blue screen).  \nWhat\u0027s wrong?  \nWith Winbuilder 082 is there better WLAN support?  \nHave Anyone un idea?  \nThanks\n\n"
