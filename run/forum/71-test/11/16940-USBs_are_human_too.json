(whatever)  \nI unplugged, replugged.  \nNew Usb device, 68MB! :smile:  \nAlso, it renamed.  \nGoogle.  \n[http://forums.sandis...ght/false#M2013](http://forums.sandisk.com/t5/All-SanDisk-USB-Flash-Drives/Cruzer-Blade-will-not-format/m-p/263749/highlight/false#M2013 \"External link\")  \n\nI opened in Hxd, to view the drive. 00. Zephir!  \n\nPhotorec and another recovery tool, nothing.  \n\nI left it. Came back today, :smile: the thing works. My files are still there, happily.  \n(The files are happy)  \nConclusion, If you ever have a similar problem, just let the Usb rest, it will be gratefull and work again.   \n"
