There are two types of partitions- primary and logical, add an extended one which is a holder for logical ones.  \nSo you can partition your disk with 4 primary partitions, of which one will be *first* , but all will be *primary* ones.  \nIn addition, C, D etc. etc. are Windows user friendly numerations and do not describe at all whether C, or D are first partition, primary, logical and so on, just a meaningless drive letter. Look at disk management console and try to provide correct information what is what, what is going to be reformatted, and where the ISO file will be if need further help.   \n"

      "content": "If you want to use an external drive to install Windows from an ISO file. You can install Grub4Dos in the external partition and launch ISO image from Grub4Dos menu.  \n\nIf you install Grub4Dos on the disk on which you install Windows (but into another partition), then... when the Windows installer finish the install... will overwrite the boot sector (replace BootLoader) and then you can\u0027t start Grub4Dos (and your ISO image), just only... the Windows installed... starts.  \n\nIf you want to install it on your main disk ... please look for information about samples to launch isos with \"Grub4Dos\" because once you install Grub4Dos in your main disk, you can not start Windows, if you have not written the necessary entries for it (on the menu of \"Grub4Dos\").  \n\nAlso note that an ISO of 2/3/4GB is too large to be loaded into RAM ... Note that this requires a lot of RAM.   \n\nI suggest only... I clarify: I don\u0027t know if it will work, I havenÂ´t experience with this matter yet.   \n"
