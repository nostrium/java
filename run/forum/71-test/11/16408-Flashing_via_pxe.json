Its size is \\~50Mb. So, I have loaded with this floppy and executed afu.exe file but nothing has been done and the system was stopped.  \n\n[http://xmages.net/st...ad/7be73fae.jpg](http://xmages.net/storage/10/1/0/5/3/upload/7be73fae.jpg \"External link\")  \n\nDid someone has the same situation?  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nThank you for your suggestions.   \n"
