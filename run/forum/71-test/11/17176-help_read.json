      "content": "I\u0027m new here in your site and I recently downloaded your Windows XP SP3 May edition (the first one that comes out when you search it to TPB). As I view the comments there, no one has ever encountered the same problem as I did. I downloaded the ISO, burnt it, and installed it. But for some reasons, I\u0027m getting this error saying that \"SETUPORG.exe does not exist in the i386 folder on UXPCD\". There\u0027s a RETRY and SKIP options and technically, i will choose the SKIP button. The installation will finish but when the computer reboots itself, it won\u0027t continue saying that there\u0027s a missing file.  \n\nC:\\\\WINDOWS\\\\system32\\\\presetup.cmd - FILE NOT FOUND!  \nC:\\\\WINDOWS\\\\system32\\\\setupORG.exe - FILE NOT FOUND!  \n(setupORG.exe - \\\u003e Original windows Setup.exe)  \n\nPOSSIBLE CAUSE:  \n1. \"Presetup.cmd\" not exist in the i386 folder on UXPCD  \n\"setupORG.exe\" not exist in the i386 folder on UXPCD  \n\n2. Check your \"Txtsetup.sif\" in the i386 folder on UXPCD  \n---Txtsetup.sif: -------------------------------------  \n\\[SourceDisksFiles\\]  \nsetupORG.exe \u003d 1,,,,,,,2,0,0; must exist  \npresetup.cmd \u003d 1,,,,,,,2,0,0; must exist  \n--------------------------------------------------------  \n\nSETUP ABORT  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nwhen i press OK, the system will reboot and will go on a loop just like this. I don\u0027t know how to solve this. I\u0027ve went through various forums and it seems that most of them haven\u0027t found the answers yet. I thought you can help me with this. I can\u0027t use my laptop now even if i run it in safe mode.   \n\nPlease help me as soon as possible. Your help will be very much appreciated.  \n\nThank you!  \n\nnote: after that i am trying to boot again the windows xp pro setup from a bootable flash drive but when i boot it  \nsays: pxe-e61 media test failure check cable  \n\nHelp!!   \n"
