There are some apps posted on this forum that tackle Linux ISOs booting by G4D as well.  \n\nIn principle, its possible to use Fat32 on portable HDs too (as in my case), and add those Linux ISOs that aren\u0027t bootable from NTFS. But I kind of like more modern and clean approach whenever possible, so picking a variety of files from various ISOs and dropping them around the disk isn\u0027t likable. Ideally, this activity should be done in RAM at boot time if not avoidable, and caused by a single boot package.  \n\nYou may want to study a bit, what FiraDisk, WinVBlock, some Wimb\u0027s apps (very strong and careful guy) and Steve6375\u0027s USB tool among others are trying to do during Win install and other tasks. It will help you a lot to improve your tool.

Since the steps will clear all your files and data in this USB drive, you need to backup them first.  \n\n1. In Windows Vista or Windows 7, open an elevated command prompt and run the following commands one by one:  \n\na) Diskpart  \nlist disk  \nYou can identify your USB drive by its size. For example, it is disk 1.  \n\nc) select disk 1  \nSelect your USB drive.  \n\nd) clean  \nClear it.  \n\ne) create partition primary  \nf) select partition 1  \ng) active  \nMark this partition as an active boot partition. This will enable this USB drive bootable.  \n\nh) format fs\u003dntfs quick  \n\n2. After formatting the USB drive, copy all the files in the DVD to the USB drive.  \n\n3. Reboot the computer and set it to boot from USB drive. Then, the computer will boot from this USB drive and you can start your installation with it.  \n\nSome of such issues are caused due to the hardware factor, you can also try upgrading DVD-ROM firmware to narrow down the issue.   \n\n**Edited by emunity, 28 January 2012 - 10:05 PM.**\n"
