If the wim file is pure unedited file, it adds its own extras to wim file. Otherwise, the program only doing the installation winpe files to usb device. USB device has to be NTFS format. The program automatically makes it bootable the usb device. In fact, it is a simple the pe program. If you want, I can share with you the source code of the program. Thank you for your interest.

      "content": "Hi TheHive :wink:  \n\nAdd Extra Features : The selected the any wim file opens as writeable on the the c:\\\\MountUSB folder. This opens the A43 file manager to access this folder. That way, if you want you can add what you want. When you close the file manager, the things you added are saved to the destination file. Of course, this feature is optional.  \n\nFormat Usb Device : This option will help you take the format to the target usb device. For this program currently not used Grub4Dos manager. So the format type should be ntfs for the Bootmgr file. I used two files to activate the boot feature of the usb device.  \n\nTo put it crudely:  \nbootsect.exe /nt60  \nMbrFix.exe setactivepartition /yes  \n\nExtract Boot.Wim (not recommanded) : The destination wim file opens as be readable to the C:\\\\MountUsb folder. Then the files in this folder are copied to the target usb device. I think, if physical ram is less, this feature can be used.  \n\nSet FilePath : If the target files (\\*.wim, BCD and BootMgr) are used by the program in different paths, you can use this feature. The paths of files is saved in UsbPE.ini .  \n\nSet DirPath : If the target files (\\*.wim, BCD and BootMgr) are used by the program in same path, you can use this feature. The path of the source is saved in UsbPE.ini .  \n\n(DVD Source)  \nBoot\\\\BCD  \nSources\\\\Boot.wim  \n\\\\BootMgr  \n\nBut if you do not use these two features, The program has to be in the same path with the target files.  \n\n(DVD Source)  \nBoot\\\\BCD  \nSources\\\\Boot.wim  \n\\\\BootMgr  \n\\\\UsbPETool.exe  \n\nYou can use these two features with the command-line.  \n\nUsbPETool.exe /DirPath \"c:\\\\Target_Dir Path\"  \n\nUsbPETool.exe /FilePath /bcd \"c:\\\\Target_Dir Path\\\\Boot\\\\BCD\" /bootwim \"d:\\\\Target_Dir Path\\\\Leopard\\\\Leopard.wim\" /bootmgr \"d:\\\\Target_Dir Path\\\\BootMgr\"  \n\nIf there is a point not mentioned, please notify me.
