AFAIK int 13h BIOSes assume 512 byte sectors, so does code in the MBR and PBR (e.g. read 2 sectors into a 1K buffer followed by code would cause a big problem if each sector was 4K in size). I think UEFI supports 4K sectors and so UEFI BIOSes would too (unsure??) but this does not use the MBR to boot (uses GPT). This is why all (99.9%??) of HDDs support 512byte emulation so you can boot from them.   \n"

      "content": "steve,  \nit is likely that there is NO MBR at all on the device ![:dubbio:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/dubbio.gif), it is - just like \"standard\" USB sticks - a \"super-floppy\", and according to the smart guy from MS that wrote about FAT 1x in the known FAT32 document (with the attitude of \"you demented that thought that, you are wrong\" forgetting that assumptions were made by a lot of people because the actual info was not disclosed) it seems like as long as there is the 55AA at offset 510 sector size is not an issue. ![:unsure:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/unsure.png)  \n\u003e BPB_BytsPerSec 11 2 Count of bytes per sector. This value may take on only the  \n\u003e following values: 512, 1024, 2048 or 4096. If maximum  \n\u003e compatibility with old implementations is desired, only the value  \n\u003e 512 should be used. There is a lot of FAT code in the world that is  \n\u003e basically \"hard wired\" to 512 bytes per sector and doesn\u0027t bother to  \n\u003e check this field to make sure it is 512. Microsoft operating systems  \n\u003e will properly support 1024, 2048, and 4096.  \n\u003e\n\u003e Note: Do not misinterpret these statements about maximum  \n\u003e compatibility. If the media being recorded has a physical sector size  \n\u003e N, you must use N and this must still be less than or equal to 4096.  \n\u003e Maximum compatibility is achieved by only using media with  \n\u003e specific sector sizes.  \n\u003e\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n\u003e There is one other important note about Sector 0 of a FAT volume. If we consider the contents of the  \n\u003e sector as a byte array, it must be true that sector\\[510\\] equals 0x55, and sector\\[511\\] equals 0xAA.   \n\u003e\n\u003e NOTE: Many FAT documents mistakenly say that this 0xAA55 signature occupies the \"last 2 bytes  \n\u003e of the boot sector\". This statement is correct if --- and only if --- BPB_BytsPerSec is 512. If  \n\u003e BPB_BytsPerSec is greater than 512, the offsets of these signature bytes do not change (although it is  \n\u003e perfectly OK for the last two bytes at the end of the boot sector to also contain this signature).\n\n[http://www.msfn.org/...-torito__st__81](http://www.msfn.org/board/topic/152399-on-bootable-cds-floppy-emulation/page__hl__el-torito__st__81 \"External link\")  \n\nAnd if you look a bit in here:  \n[http://www.msfn.org/...d-their-images/](http://www.msfn.org/board/topic/152097-on-superfloppies-and-their-images/ \"External link\")  \nyou will see how there is a \"historical\" floppy format that used 1,024 bytes/sector (that we anyway decided to exclude from the WIP).  \n\nAt least, this is what I meant with \"Theoretically\". :smile:  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif)  \nWonko   \n"

This statement is correct if --- and only if --- BPB_BytsPerSec is 512. If  \n\u003e BPB_BytsPerSec is greater than 512, the offsets of these signature bytes do not change (although it is  \n\u003e perfectly OK for the last two bytes at the end of the boot sector to also contain this signature).\n\n[http://www.msfn.org/...-torito__st__81](http://www.msfn.org/board/topic/152399-on-bootable-cds-floppy-emulation/page__hl__el-torito__st__81 \"External link\")  \n\nAnd if you look a bit in here:  \n[http://www.msfn.org/...d-their-images/](http://www.msfn.org/board/topic/152097-on-superfloppies-and-their-images/ \"External link\")  \nyou will see how there is a \"historical\" floppy format that used 1,024 bytes/sector (that we anyway decided to exclude from the WIP).  \n\nAt least, this is what I meant with \"Theoretically\". :smile:  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif)  \nWonko   \n"

      "content": "@Wonko  \nScared to post this fear of being laughed at but could this help in some way ?  \nTo configure the drive:\n\n* Set the drive mode to LBA in the BIOS setup.\n* Boot Solaris.  \n  WARNING! Continuing will destroy any partitions that are on this drive.\n* Create a disk geometry file for Solaris.  \n  WARNING! EXCEEDING 16383 CYLINDERS WILL LOCK-UP YOUR DISK DRIVE.   \n  Our formula: x \\* y \\* z \u003d s. Where x is the number of cylinders (x cannot exceed (2\\*\\*14) - 1 \u003d 16383), y is the number of heads, z is the number of sectors per track, and s is the total number of sectors available on the drive. By setting y \u003d 1, we get the following:  \n  x \\* 1 \\* z \u003d s, or x \\* z \u003d s. By further setting x \u003d 16383, we get: 16383 \\* z \u003d s.   \n  Solve for z (number of sectors per track): z \u003d s / 16383. For example:  \n  Western Digital AC 418000 (18.2GB) - Total sectors \u003d 35,239,680. 35,239,680 / 16383 \u003d 2150.99 \u003d 2150  \n  NOTE: All results must be rounded down. Solaris reserves three cylinders, so making x smaller would end up wasting space.   \n  Create a file called \"geometry\" like the following (using our example above) where NSECT is the value solved for z (2150):   \n  \\* Label geometry for device /dev/rdsk/c0d0p0  \n  \\* PCYL NCYL ACYL BCYL NHEAD NSECT SECSIZ  \n  16383 16383 2 0 1 2150 512\n* Run fdisk in Solaris using the new geometry file:  \n  fdisk -S geometry -I /dev/rdsk/c1d0p0  \n  Replace \"/dev/rdsk/c1d0p0\" with your raw disk device (The trick is to let fdisk ignore the geometry reported by the BIOS and use the geometry specified in file \"geometry\" instead).\n* From here on, you can format, partition, and make filesystems on the drive in the usual manner.\n\nFor details see the fdisk(1M), prtvtoc(1M), and fmthard(1M) man page.  \n\\[Thanks to Pete Howell and Jürgen Marenda\\]   \n"
