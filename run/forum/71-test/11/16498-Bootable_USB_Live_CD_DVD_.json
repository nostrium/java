      "content": "Appologies to the mods if this is in the wrong place. If so please move it to the correct group.  \n\nOk just did a back up a netbook recovery partition to a USB stick (between 8 GB and 9 GB, so it will take 2 x DVD). It wouldn\u0027t backup the recovery partition to optical disks, or iso\u0027s. Just USB sticks. Also Asus AI Recovery doesn\u0027t work on this model according to Asus support.  \n\nAnd so I want to free up the USB stick, and also feel that the image on the USB stick wont survive as well as one on a non-rewritable DVD. Especially when people reach for the nearest USB stick they can find.  \n\nSo there\u0027s plenty of guides on how to convert live CD\u0027s to bootable USB\u0027s, but there seems to be a dearth of instructions on how to convert bootable USB\u0027s to live DVD\u0027s. Don\u0027t forget the spanning across 2 DVD\u0027s :smile:  \n\nNow I believe the bootloader of USB\u0027s is different to the iso9660 of DVD\u0027s? However to further complicate it the recovery OS on the USB is a Win PE, possibly ver 3. I had a look and it looks like Win PE, but not sure of the version. Am just guessing.  \n\nI thought about using linux to dd the USB image into an iso, and then using an iso editor to edit the boot files. But I\u0027m not quite sure whether that will work, considering the USB has a Win PE on it.  \n\nAny suggestions? Does microsoft have any tools?   \n"

Why not just take an image of the USB drive and store it on your PC and backup storage using RMPrepUSB Drive--\\\u003eFile.\n\n* What I would do is copy of all the files from your working USB drive to your hard disk.\n* Use RMPrepUSb to reformat the USB drive to a size just big enough to hold the files.\n* Then copy back all the files to the USB drive.\n* Then use Drive--\\\u003eFile to make an image of the drive.\n* Then ZIP it up and store it somewhere.\n* If you really want DVDs (which by the way R/W DVDs only last a few years anyway) then why not split the ZIP file into two files and burn them to two DVDs (together with RMPrepUSB and a readme with instructions on how to make a new USB drive in case you forget later!).\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks for your suggestion Steve!  \n\nI may do that. I think the HDD storage option is somewhat risky. At my place HDD\u0027s have an average lifespan of 3 to 5 years before they get the click of death. So I could still store it on DVD\u0027s with instructions on how to restore it.  \n\nBut I must admit I am surprised that there hasn\u0027t been much development converting bootable USB\u0027s to Live CD/DVD\u0027s! Maybe good reasons for it, but still came as a surprise considering there is a plethora of Live CD or iso --\\\u003e bootable USB methods.  \n\nThanks again!   \n"
