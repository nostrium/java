      "content": "Hi,\n\nI use AIO for creating an USB Boot Stick. All works fine.  \nWith many help from Steve I managed Windows 10 Iso Install before.\n\nNow it\u0027s a little fine tuning :smile:\n\nOn Legacy BIOS mode I boot with: grub4dos  \nOn UEFI mode I boot with: grub2\n\nWith AIO Creator I integraded my WIn7All_Install.iso to the stick.  \nA boot.wim was created wich is loaded now:\n\n```\n### Start \\AIO\\Files\\WinSetup\\Win7AllDVD\nif [ -n \"$pc\" ]; then\nmenuentry \"Windows 7 installieren - All in One\" {\n\twimboot \"/AIO/Files/WinSetup/Win7AllDVD/boot.wim\"\n}\nfi\n### Legacy: {3e739b1d-6e8a-783c-859d-83ee938e5781}\n### End \\AIO\\Files\\WinSetup\\Win7AllDVD\n```\n\nNow I want use it with grub2.\n\nWhen I add the code above to and boot it, all seems to work but then dissapears the grub2 menu again.\n\nAny suggestions how I can managed it?\n\nThanks :smile:\n\n"

      "content": "Yes, forget about complicating your life if there is a proven easy way to get same results, this is the way I (and many people) use to do it:\n\nAll you need is WinPEx86 or x64 as your requirements/likes wich can be loaded directly from [AIO_Boot](https://www.aioboot.com/en/ \"External link\"), [E2B](http://www.easy2boot.com/ \"External link\") or any other way you want, have on the root of your USB device a folder with [WinNTSetup](https://msfn.org/board/topic/149612-winntsetup-v394-40-rc1/ \"External link\") (previously extracted and ran at least once on any PC to download some files/folders from MS servers) and just run the x86 or x64 version of it from your booted WinPE (respecting WinPE architecture), a copy of your install (or any name you want to use) .wim or .esd or .Iso containing it, on a folder on the root of your USB device, select it and then the version you want to install from it, apply some tricks if you want, add aditional drivers or also use your custom unatted.xml, and just install from it.\n\nIt let you make your partitions on the target disk the way you like (MBR or GPT for UEFI) also has lists available to select for making automatically your partitions on empty disk (first time installs or when you clean all your partitions).\n\nSimple and easy and proven to be reliable for years.\n\nMaybe you would like to see this thread: [http://reboot.pro/to...+your +own +aio](http://reboot.pro/topic/21852-make-your-own-updated-x86x64-esds-to-install-oss-from-usb/?hl\u003d%2Bmake+%2Byour+%2Bown+%2Baio \"\")\n\nalacran\n\n"
