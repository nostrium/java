But to my surprise when booted from it I got a message from grub4dos saying it can\u0027t find menu.lst, I tried to check if something was wrong but all was just as my USBs with grub4dos, so for an unknown reason this did not work.  \n\nNext I deleted the Iso folder, grld and menu.lst and installed AIO Boot but without formating the Micro-SD to don\u0027t losse my info, and installed the preselected option grub2 on MBR and with AIO Boot installed several WimPE .wim an Linux Lite x64 (Live), this time the PC booted fine from the Micro-SD on the cellphone and all runs fine.\n\n**EDIT:** It seems there was a problem with C/H/S geometry of the Micro-SD card. Thanks to **steve6375** the issue on grub4dos to find the menu.lst is solved now, once booting from grub4dos just by typing on command line the following:\n\nQuote from [Post No. 17](http://reboot.pro/topic/22172-booting-wimpes-linux-lives-on-the-pc-from-the-micro-sd-on-my-smartphone/#entry213017 \"\")\n\u003e geometry --sync (hd0) \\\u003e\\\u003e\\\u003e A message appeared saying:  \n\u003e\n\u003e Writing MBR for drive 0X80 ...sucess.  \n\u003e Partition num: 0, active, file system Fat 32, partition type 0X0C ...  \n\u003e\n\u003e Then I pressed ESC key and the menu.lst was visible finally.  \n\u003e\n\u003e Rebooted the PC twice and menu.lst appeared inmediatly as it usually does.  \n\n**Now booting from grub4dos is possible too.**\n\nalacran\n\n**Edited by alacran, 16 October 2019 - 09:00 AM.**\n"

But to my surprise when booted from it I got a message from grub4dos saying it can\u0027t find menu.lst, I tried to check if something was wrong but all was just as my USBs with grub4dos, so for an unknown reason this did not work.  \n\nNext I deleted the Iso folder, grld and menu.lst and installed AIO Boot but without formating the Micro-SD to don\u0027t losse my info, and installed the preselected option grub2 on MBR and with AIO Boot installed several WimPE .wim an Linux Lite x64 (Live), this time the PC booted fine from the Micro-SD on the cellphone and all runs fine.\n\n**EDIT:** It seems there was a problem with C/H/S geometry of the Micro-SD card. Thanks to **steve6375** the issue on grub4dos to find the menu.lst is solved now, once booting from grub4dos just by typing on command line the following:\n\nQuote from [Post No. 17](http://reboot.pro/topic/22172-booting-wimpes-linux-lives-on-the-pc-from-the-micro-sd-on-my-smartphone/#entry213017 \"\")\n\u003e geometry --sync (hd0) \\\u003e\\\u003e\\\u003e A message appeared saying:  \n\u003e\n\u003e Writing MBR for drive 0X80 ...sucess.  \n\u003e Partition num: 0, active, file system Fat 32, partition type 0X0C ...  \n\u003e\n\u003e Then I pressed ESC key and the menu.lst was visible finally.  \n\u003e\n\u003e Rebooted the PC twice and menu.lst appeared inmediatly as it usually does.  \n\n**Now booting from grub4dos is possible too.**\n\nalacran\n\n**Edited by alacran, 16 October 2019 - 09:00 AM.**\n"
