So it still might be mostly compatible with the existing process.\n\nI\u0027m trying to download an ARM ISO ATM to see where it leads, and also trying the 1709 ADK to see if I can build a PE USB stick with it.\n\nOn that note, are there any pre-existing PE packages for use with DISM to add x86 support to a PE ARM bootable USB?

This hung during the NTFS service initialization stage, even though it displayed aarm64 properly at the bootup stage. So I could not boot from USB. I was forced to use NTFS with Rufus, because the 1803 Windows 10 ISO ARM downloader actually created a WIM file larger than 4GB as part of its process.\n\n- I attempted to merge several ESD files into the Winre.WIM file that I extracted, even after manually converting them to CAB files; but these were rejected by DISM with error \"5\" (Access Denied) as they were somehow unqualified to be merged with the RE instance WIM.\n\nSo I bit the bullet and switched to Pro mode from S; it took just a second (or two). I don\u0027t know how they\u0027ve done it Wonko, but my favorite archiver (DiskZIP) even runs in this Pro mode successfully. While it would not compress my disk due to an error while trying to set up for reboot, the shell extensions worked - which was a surprise, to be sure. I know DiskZIP doesn\u0027t have ARM64 support - so how Microsoft got their shell extensions to work in an ARM64 compiled explorer.exe process is a mystery to me! The archives-as-folders feature did not work, but how is Microsoft supporting the other right-clicks? This is truly amazing.\n\n"

This hung during the NTFS service initialization stage, even though it displayed aarm64 properly at the bootup stage. So I could not boot from USB. I was forced to use NTFS with Rufus, because the 1803 Windows 10 ISO ARM downloader actually created a WIM file larger than 4GB as part of its process.\n\n- I attempted to merge several ESD files into the Winre.WIM file that I extracted, even after manually converting them to CAB files; but these were rejected by DISM with error \"5\" (Access Denied) as they were somehow unqualified to be merged with the RE instance WIM.\n\nSo I bit the bullet and switched to Pro mode from S; it took just a second (or two). I don\u0027t know how they\u0027ve done it Wonko, but my favorite archiver (DiskZIP) even runs in this Pro mode successfully. While it would not compress my disk due to an error while trying to set up for reboot, the shell extensions worked - which was a surprise, to be sure. I know DiskZIP doesn\u0027t have ARM64 support - so how Microsoft got their shell extensions to work in an ARM64 compiled explorer.exe process is a mystery to me! The archives-as-folders feature did not work, but how is Microsoft supporting the other right-clicks? This is truly amazing.\n\n"
