All booting with grub4dos.\n\nThe problem is on some computers usb mouse and keyboard won\u0027t work.\n\nIf the iso uses some own usb driver like acronis than all works great.\n\nSo can I add some USB driver bevore loading an iso, so that the loaded isos work fine?\n\n"

You may use this.  \nBut this works only as far as BIOS routines are used.  \n\nAny modern OS uses own drivers, no BIOS routines to access hardware.  \nThe USB drivers has to be loaded by the iso OS.  \nE.g. Windows 7 dosn\u0027t support USB 3 out of the box.  \nA grub4dos/BIOS add on won\u0027t work at a Windows 7. Include windows 7 USB 3 driver to the iso.  \n\nNo, you can\u0027t add some generic USB driver before loading an iso, so that all loaded isos work fine.  \nEach iso is seperate challenge, with a seperate solution.   \n"

Use Windows 10 source files. There are generic USB 3.0 drivers included by default.  \n\nWhich hardware do you use? Which USB 3.0 controller? Which HardwareID does match?  \nIs there a USB 2.0 port available?  \n\nDism can add drivers.  \n[https://docs.microso...e-windows-image](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/add-and-remove-drivers-to-an-offline-windows-image \"External link\")   \n"
