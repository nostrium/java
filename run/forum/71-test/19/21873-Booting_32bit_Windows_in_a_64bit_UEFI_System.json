      "content": "Hi;\n\nI need to boot 32bit Windows in my laptop which is 64bit. I have tried some ways also searched internet but no success. e.g. Tried chainloading 32bit Windows UEFI boot manager from Clover and Grub, Tried 64bit Windows UEFI bootmanager to boot 32bit Windows (gives invalid signature error for ntoskrnl.exe), tried rEFInd to boot MBR (said CSM isn\u0027t supported by my mobo or is disabled) .\n\nIs there any solution for this?\n\nThanks\n\n"
