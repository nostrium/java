I used some other tools as well and I attached them below.  \n\nI don\u0027t get a 7B error or blue screen but when I boot it just shows the Windows 7 boot animation, then goes to a black screen. I then am forced to shut down with the power button because nothing happens.  \n\nDoes anyone have any experience working with this problem? I attached my system registry hive in case anyone notices an issue there too.  \n\nTools: [tools.zip](http://www.mediafire.com/file/h71ho4grdiy56j2/tools.zip \"External link\")  \nSystem Hive: [SYSTEM](http://www.mediafire.com/file/t8cktsqa61px8q6/SYSTEM \"External link\")\n\n"

However, I am already past installation stage and am trying to troubleshoot post-installation. Here is some evidence other people have it working: [reboot.pro thread](http://reboot.pro/topic/14186-usb-hdd-boot-and-windows-7-sp1/?p\u003d125903 \"\"). No source on that quote though.\n\nAnyway, I did try it.

But... I believe \"no legacy support\" simply means Microsoft will block us from updates, which is easily bypassed with this tool: [wufuc](https://github.com/zeffy/wufuc \"External link\"). Thank you for finding this resource.\n\nIf I had to guess, though, I think the problem is still less that Kaby Lake is not receiving updates than some issue with USB.\n\n![077daeeb88cbfd42fe0c7709e03e3487.jpg](https://i.gyazo.com/077daeeb88cbfd42fe0c7709e03e3487.jpg)\n\n**Edited by NinYagami, 10 February 2018 - 11:49 AM.**\n"

      "content": "@NinYagami: I have an i7-7700K (unlocked and overclocked) as well, so my CPU is also officially locked to Windows 10. This doesn\u0027t bother me much, I have no desire to run an older version of Windows on my current hardware. But it is still quite dirty of Microsoft/OEMs to pull some shit like this. I wouldnt be surprised if Intel/AMD later added a provision (via a firmware update) to detect older Windows as they boot and halt the bootup in its\u0027 tracks.  \n\nYou may think that it is only limited to updates, but drivers are also covered too. Microsoft can convince Intel to stop updating drivers for people that are trying to run Windows 10 on Kaby Lake/Skylake CPUs. Good luck finding an official Windows 7 chipset driver for your CPU.  \n\nIt\u0027s also important to note that other OSes like Linux are unaffected, old Linux distros continue to run fine on the latest Intel CPUs.   \n"
