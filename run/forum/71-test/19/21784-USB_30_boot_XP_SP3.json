No yellow questionmark remains in device manager.\n\nBut the very best is: After making USB bootfriendly, the asmedia 3.0 driver with\n\nSystem Reserved and start 0 in registry for hub and also for the usb device,\n\nstarts full XP SP3 in 2(!) seconds.\n\nIt is unbelievable fast, boot device is a USB stick Sandisk Extreme pro Usb3.1, shows now with CrystalDismark5\n\n300 MByte/s,\n\nhave a nice day\n\nDietmar\n\n"
