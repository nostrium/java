      "content": "Hello all. We have been PXE booting servers for quite some time without issue. We ran into our first problem and after a day or two of troubleshooting, I have no idea where to go.\n\nThe server is Dell M630 that is part of a blade system. We are trying to deploy server 2012r2.\n\nThe current issue I have is a BSOD right after the boot.wim windows splash image. I can\u0027t seem to get to any command prompt to even begin debugging or troubleshooting. I\u0027ve tried the latest Win10ADK boot.wim, I\u0027ve tried about 15-20 other boot.wim\u0027s with various driver attempts. Still no luck.   \n\nHow do I begin to troubleshoot this? I seemingly cant get any dump, cmd prompt, anything to be able to figure out what is happening. The error code, as all windows error codes are, is completely unhelpful.\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/KJdVfNC.png](https://i.imgur.com/KJdVfNC.png \"External link\")\n\nAny ideas where to go from here?\n\n"

      "content": "Wow.. After 3 days of troubleshooting I resolved it, 45 mins after I made this post.\n\nThe issue appears to be an outdated wimboot. I downloaded the last copy courtesy of [http://ipxe.org/wimboot](http://ipxe.org/wimboot \"External link\")and it no longers BSODs. Now I just cant see the NICs, but thats a different, likely easier scenario to fix.\n\n"
