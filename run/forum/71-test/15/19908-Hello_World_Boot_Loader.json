This like any other boot loader has to obey a few rules.\n\n[http://www.osdever.n...rld-boot-loader](http://www.osdever.net/tutorials/view/hello-world-boot-loader \"External link\")\n\nA code example:\n\n[https://github.com/pcoutin/nerdroll](https://github.com/pcoutin/nerdroll \"External link\")\n\n![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif)\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n"
