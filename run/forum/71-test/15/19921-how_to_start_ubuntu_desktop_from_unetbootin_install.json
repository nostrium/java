      "content": "Hello,\n\nI recently used UNetbootin to install a version of Ubuntu 12.04 onto a USB flash drive. I am having trouble trying to start Ubuntu now. My approach has been to plug the flash drive in and let the BIOS boot from it automatically (starts the first found drive first). However Ubuntu does not start, instead this is what happens:\n\nI get what appears to be a linux terminal window that is full screen. At the top it says:\n\n\"BusyBox v1.18.5 Ubuntu 1:.1.18.5-1ubuntu4.1 built in shell (ash) enter help for list of built-in commands.\"\n\nAnd then there is a long list of text that scrolls by, the last line is:\n\n\"ata4: SATA link down (SStatus 0 Scontrol 300)\"\n\nThen there is a prompt: \"(initramfs)\" which responds to typical unix commands such as ls, cd, ... reboot. And I can see the typical unix directory structures.\n\nI have reinstalled using UNetbootin with the same results.\n\nSo how do I get the Ubuntu desktop to start?? I have run Ubuntu 10.04 from a UNetbootin USB installation without issue.\n\nthanks!\n\nsteve\n\n"
