      "content": "As a matter of fact I doubt that - since we are the ***UN*** official support forum for grub***4dos*** - a large number of ~~bootland~~ reboot.pro users are using GRUB (now senselessly renamed to GRUB legacy) or GRUB (the name senselessly given to GRUB2), whilst many will be using grub***4dos*** (which is NOT GRUB and it is NOT GRUB2) that is missing among the choices.  \n\nSo the most used tools wiil be either Syslinux/Isolinux or grub***4dos*** .  \n\nThis latter can be booted (or chainloaded) in several different ways, and personally I have NEVER seen it fail to boot, with the only exception of some peculiar motherboards that do not \"like\" it when it is installed to the MBR (+hidden sectors), in which case (and this is the approach I tend to use) a \"normal\" MBR (like the one provided with Syslinux) code and grub4dos chainloaded by the bootsector works fine.  \n\nAs a side note, it makes (to me) very little sense to have a \"vague\" statistics of how much something fails or succeeds when you have no idea of when/where it fails or how exactly was set up when it fails or how it fails.  \n\nLet\u0027s say that - hypothesis - grub4dos fails (when installed to the MBR+hidden sectors) on a Fujitsu-Siemens S200/S220/S300. (actually it is not a hypothesis, it is documented and it works fine once chainloaded from the bootsector).  \n\nHow many people do you know (besides myself) that actually:\n\n* use such a machine\n* use such a machine AND want/need to boot it from USB\n* use such a machine AND want/need to boot it from USB AND NOT want to use a \"normal\" MBR\n\nIf someone is in case #3, the fail rate is 100%.  \nIf someone is in case #2, the fail rate is 0% (as a \"normal\" MBR is used)  \nBUT, besides the above, if case #1 represents say 0.01% of the around 65000 members of bootland, i.e. there are actually 6 1/2 members with that hardware, how likely do you think that they will vote on this poll, and which influence/relevance would their vote have?  \n\nAnd we haven\u0027t even touched the issues about the zillion versions that exist of both Syslinux and grub4dos and the possibility that the user has not the competence to have them installed/set up properly.   \n\n![:duff:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/duff.gif)  \nWonko   \n"

Occasionally I need to chain load grub4dos to use --map but if syslinux gains this functionality ill never need grub4dos again.\n\nagree with wonko though. grub4dos needs to be a choice as all the projects here either use grub4dos (which is NOT GRUB\\[legacy\\] or GRUB2) or syslinkux/isolinux/pelinux\n\n"
