( my flash is basic disk now ) .  \ni do mean windows 7 and 8 install iso\u0027s .  \n\nmy problem is to create four windows 7 install iso\u0027s from the same flash memory ,, since windows install extract can only be 1 on the flash memory partition , so i thought to divide my flash memory into 4 partition and choose between them from the bios booting menu .  \n\ni have no idea if what i am asking for is hard or easy ,but the flipflop was very easy  \n[http://reboot.pro/to...ingstone-32-gb/](http://reboot.pro/topic/20235-flipflop-kingstone-32-gb/ \"\")  \n\nQuestion :  \ncan i install IPL (initial boot loader ) and link it to the PBR of each parition like the normal booting at this artical  \n[http://www.multiboot.../multiboot.html](http://www.multibooters.co.uk/multiboot.html \"External link\")  \n\nif there are any articals i should read please send me the links\n\n**Edited by Abdo Refky, 06 January 2015 - 03:34 PM.**\n"

      "content": "The way that Windows Install ISOs work is that they boot to WinPE and run Setup.exe\n\nSetup.exe then looks for a \\\\sources\\\\install.wim file. If the Install.wim file are inside an ISO, it will never be found and you will get a \u0027Windows CD\\\\DVD drive driver is missing\u0027 error.\n\nEven if you extracted all of the ISOs to separate partitions, there would still be a problem - no matter which partition you booted from, it will just find the first \\\\sources\\\\install.wim that it finds.\n\nI am not sure what you are trying to achieve or why - there are existing solutions like WinSetupFromUSB or my Easy2Boot project which will install multiple ISOs all from one partition - so why re-invent the wheel?\n\nIf you want to dabble, see [here](http://www.rmprepusb.com/tutorials/firawiniso \"External link\").\n\n"
