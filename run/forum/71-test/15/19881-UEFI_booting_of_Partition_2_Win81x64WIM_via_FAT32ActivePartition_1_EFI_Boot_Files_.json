I want to build a new house, with a wooden frame, that is 35 storeys tall. Where do I begin?\n\nA. You need to first study some basics of constructions/structures, then you will need to learn how to join together planks and beams of timber. Noone has ever managed to build a 35 storeys wooden structure, however, it is impossible at the current level of engineering and - besides that - the way to build a wooden house is different depending on your region, on which kind of timber you have available which kind of tools you have available, etc.\n\nQ.I don\u0027t want to study structures I want to build a house and I want it 35 storeys tall. I don\u0027t want to become an engineer or a carpenter, I want to build a wooden house and I want it 35 storeys tall.\n\nA.Yes, we got that, what you missed is that it is impossible, simply because there are not big enough wooden beams, nails and hammers to build that.\n\nQ.What is a hammer? What is a nail? What is a beam? Why does a nail have a head and a pointed end? Which side do you plant nails in wood? How do you use a hammer?\n\nA. You need to study some very basics on wooden structures and how they are built, learn to use at a basic level the tools used by carpenters and do some practice with them, building smaller/simpler structures instead of asking these questions.\n\nQ. I have read that screws are better than nails. How come I cannot use a screwdriver to drive a nail? What if I use a screwdriver to make a hole in a wooden beam? Can I use a wooden peg instead of a nail? If I use a screw instead of a wooden peg, can I use glue to fix it? Why glue is not black? I want to use black glue. Why glue is not dark blue? I think that I can use black glue together with dark blue glue. Can I mix black glue with dark blue glue? What colour will the mix come out? Can I drive a nail into a wooden peg? Isn\u0027t it better if I drive both a nail and a screw in a hole I made for a wooden peg? And then add some glue to it?\n\nA. ![:frusty:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/frusty.gif)\n\n![:duff:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/duff.gif)\n\nWonko\n\n"

There may be lots of chances to be distracted from the way. Actually I know some basics but there are still lots of confusions because of different education steam. And AFAIK, some teachers may also have wrong concepts regarding some simple basics. And whenever a student ask questions, then they clear their concepts once again and feel that their concept was wrong. And I am just a newbie in computing , It\u0027s why I am trying to solve my confusion by asking to the experts. Actually your standard of thinking is very big and tremendous and I never could reach to that level. It seems that It\u0027s why you quickly declare my questions as crazy and stupid. I think It may be generation gap. AFAIK,**\u0027Steve\u0027** sir is also a very experienced and extra-ordinary person, But he never treat my crazy,stupid and foolish question like you. If you do not like my stupid questions, then why you respond them. I think you should utilize your precious time in Intelligent questions as extra-ordinary person normally do.\n\nAnd for you kind information I want to tell you that my goal is in final stage due to lots of help and support by **Steve, cdob, Misty, ktp, alacran, JFX, wimb and definitely *Wonko the Sane................*** ![:worship:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/worship.gif)\n\nLots of thanks, honor and Regards for giving me your precious time..................... :smile:\n\nThanks to Everyone..............\n\n**Edited by devdevadev, 01 July 2014 - 11:26 AM.**\n"

And you want to put the boot files on the visible partition and boot.wim (or Win8.1_x64.WIM in your case) on the hidden partition?  \n\nI don\u0027t know about more recent versions of Windows, but the last time I played around with multiple partitions on a Removable USB disk I was using Windows XP - I required a filter driver in order to be able to access the additional partitions (the Hitachi Microdrive Filter). Assuming you can access both partitions under Windows (through a filter or natively), then it should be easy for you to run a test.  \n\nI\u0027d recommend using a visible partition to start with - if this works, then set the partition as hidden and retest. For the test - create a BCD store on the first partition. Add the entries required for WinPE to the BCD store and (assuming the first partition is mounted as drive D: and the second partition is mounted as E: as in this example) make sure the paths are set -  \n\n```\nbcdedit.exe /store D:\\EFI\\microsoft\\boot\\BCD /set {guid} osdevice ramdisk\u003d[E:]\\Win8.1_x64.WIM,{ramdiskoptions}\nbcdedit.exe /store D:\\EFI\\microsoft\\boot\\BCD /set {guid} device ramdisk\u003d[E:]\\Win8.1_x64.WIM,{ramdiskoptions}\n```\n\nThis is from memory - you may need to tweak this.

You could do a quick test in a VM - I don\u0027t have the time at the moment.  \n\u003e\n\u003e I don\u0027t have a UEFI system myself and asked the kind reboot.pro forum members for advice about USB UEFI booting [here](http://reboot.pro/topic/19797-questions-about-usb-booting-on-uefi-systems/ \"\") - this thread may prove useful.  \n\u003e\n\u003e You can rename \\\\Windows\\\\boot\\\\EFI\\\\bootmgfw.efi as \\\\EFI\\\\boot\\\\bootx64.efi if this file is missing.\n\nThanks for sharing very useful UEFI discussion link with me. I have got lots of fresh knowledge from your thread........\n\n\u003e Your goal appears to be to partition a removable type USB disk with two partitions - one of which you refer to as \"Super Hidden\" in other posts? And you want to put the boot files on the visible partition and boot.wim (or Win8.1_x64.WIM in your case) on the hidden partition?\n\nDefinitively, I want exactly the same. But after reading **cdob** line**\"A manufacturer may support first partiton entry only or all four entries.\" .** I think that I will have to put **Boot Files** (both BIOS and UEFI files) in both**\u0027Partition 1\u0027** and **\u0027Partition 2\u0027** . And will have to make **\u0027Partition 1\u0027** as **\u0027Active\u0027** Partition. After that I will use **\u0027******Attrib\u0027**** commands in order to Hide each and every content of both Partitions so that **\u0027Boot Files\u0027** of **\u0027Partition 1\u0027** be Invisible.\n\n\u003e I was using Windows XP - I required a filter driver in order to be able to access the additional partitions (the Hitachi Microdrive Filter). Assuming you can access both partitions under Windows (through a filter or natively), then it should be easy for you to run a test.\n\nI tried to search for a Win8.1SE script for **\u0027Filter Driver\u0027** , but not found any script till now. And finally I have to use**\u0027DISM GUI 3.5\u0027** in order to integrate**cfadisk/diskmod** filter driver into \u0027boot.WIM\u0027 file.  \n\u003e I\u0027d recommend using a visible partition to start with - if this works, then set the partition as hidden and retest. For the test - create a BCD store on the first partition. Add the entries required for WinPE to the BCD store and (assuming the first partition is mounted as drive D: and the second partition is mounted as E: as in this example) make sure the paths are set -\n\u003e bcdedit.exe /store D:\\\\EFI\\\\microsoft\\\\boot\\\\BCD /set {guid} osdevice ramdisk\u003d\\[E:\\]\\\\Win8.1_x64.WIM,{ramdiskoptions}  \n\u003e bcdedit.exe /store D:\\\\EFI\\\\microsoft\\\\boot\\\\BCD /set {guid} device ramdisk\u003d\\[E:\\]\\\\Win8.1_x64.WIM,{ramdiskoptions}  \n\u003e This is from memory - you may need to tweak this. You will also need to set {ramdiskoptions} to point to your .sdi file.  \n\u003e\n\u003e diddy\u0027s BCDEdit notes might prove useful - see [http://diddy.boot-land.net/bcdedit/](http://diddy.boot-land.net/bcdedit/ \"External link\")  \n\u003e\n\u003e EDIT - the Devices section in diddy\u0027s guide should prove particularly useful - [http://diddy.boot-la...iles/device.htm](http://diddy.boot-land.net/bcdedit/files/device.htm \"External link\")\n\nThanks for describing things in such a simple and detailed manner. Actually I am not so comfortable with command lines due to very low Vison of my Eyes, It\u0027s why I have to use **\u0027Bootice/BCD Edit\u0027** in order to edit/modify **\u0027BCD Store Entries\u0027.**\n\n***Regards...........*** ![:worship:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/worship.gif)\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n"

I want to build a new house, with a wooden frame, that is 35 storeys tall. Where do I begin?\n\nA. You need to first study some basics of constructions/structures, then you will need to learn how to join together planks and beams of timber. Noone has ever managed to build a 35 storeys wooden structure, however, it is impossible at the current level of engineering and - besides that - the way to build a wooden house is different depending on your region, on which kind of timber you have available which kind of tools you have available, etc.\n\nQ.I don\u0027t want to study structures I want to build a house and I want it 35 storeys tall. I don\u0027t want to become an engineer or a carpenter, I want to build a wooden house and I want it 35 storeys tall.\n\nA.Yes, we got that, what you missed is that it is impossible, simply because there are not big enough wooden beams, nails and hammers to build that.\n\nQ.What is a hammer? What is a nail? What is a beam? Why does a nail have a head and a pointed end? Which side do you plant nails in wood? How do you use a hammer?\n\nA. You need to study some very basics on wooden structures and how they are built, learn to use at a basic level the tools used by carpenters and do some practice with them, building smaller/simpler structures instead of asking these questions.\n\nQ. I have read that screws are better than nails. How come I cannot use a screwdriver to drive a nail? What if I use a screwdriver to make a hole in a wooden beam? Can I use a wooden peg instead of a nail? If I use a screw instead of a wooden peg, can I use glue to fix it? Why glue is not black? I want to use black glue. Why glue is not dark blue? I think that I can use black glue together with dark blue glue. Can I mix black glue with dark blue glue? What colour will the mix come out? Can I drive a nail into a wooden peg? Isn\u0027t it better if I drive both a nail and a screw in a hole I made for a wooden peg? And then add some glue to it?\n\nA. ![:frusty:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/frusty.gif)\n\n![:duff:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/duff.gif)\n\nWonko\n\n"

There may be lots of chances to be distracted from the way. Actually I know some basics but there are still lots of confusions because of different education steam. And AFAIK, some teachers may also have wrong concepts regarding some simple basics. And whenever a student ask questions, then they clear their concepts once again and feel that their concept was wrong. And I am just a newbie in computing , It\u0027s why I am trying to solve my confusion by asking to the experts. Actually your standard of thinking is very big and tremendous and I never could reach to that level. It seems that It\u0027s why you quickly declare my questions as crazy and stupid. I think It may be generation gap. AFAIK,**\u0027Steve\u0027** sir is also a very experienced and extra-ordinary person, But he never treat my crazy,stupid and foolish question like you. If you do not like my stupid questions, then why you respond them. I think you should utilize your precious time in Intelligent questions as extra-ordinary person normally do.\n\nAnd for you kind information I want to tell you that my goal is in final stage due to lots of help and support by **Steve, cdob, Misty, ktp, alacran, JFX, wimb and definitely *Wonko the Sane................*** ![:worship:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/worship.gif)\n\nLots of thanks, honor and Regards for giving me your precious time..................... :smile:\n\nThanks to Everyone..............\n\n**Edited by devdevadev, 01 July 2014 - 11:26 AM.**\n"

It means that as everyone has been telling you there are DIFFERENT EFI and UEFI implementations and they may behave DIFFERENTLY.\n\n2.Yes/no/maybe. (see #1)\n\n3.Yes/no/maybe (see #1)\n\n4.Yes/no/maybe (see #1)\n\n5.No, you cannot install \"grub4dos\" to \"MBR boot Code\", you can install grub4dos (grldr.mbr) to the MBR **and** a number of following hidden sectors. You cannot install \"Boot Manager\" to \"MBR boot Code\".\n\n6.Yes, but no, the MBR will contain only first sector of the grub4dos grldr.mbr, the rest will be written to following (hidden) sectors.\n\n7.No. It will install \"standard\" MBR boot code. There are tens of \"standard\" MBR boot codes which function is to chainload the PBR/VBR of the partition marked as active in the MBR partition table..\n\n8.When you do nothing you get nothing. The default is a \"standard\" MBR boot code\", see #7\n\n9.It is NOT POSSIBLE to \"install bootmgr into MBR boot code\", see #5, #6, #7 and #8\n\n10.It is NOT POSSIBLE to \"install bootmgr into MBR boot code\", see #5, #6, #7, #8 and #9\n\n11.It is a set of assembler instructions that cannot exceed 440 bytes in length and that are loaded by the BIOS when booting.\n\n12.The MBR is by definition the first absolute sector of any hard disk like device, CHS 0/0/1, LBA0, 512 bytes in size and contining Boot Code, Disk Signature, Partition Table and Magic Bytes. getting here (already provided indirectly in Steve6375\u0027s answer) might be of benefit for you: [http://thestarman.pc.../mbr/index.html](http://thestarman.pcministry.com/asm/mbr/index.html \"External link\")\n\n13. It is NOT POSSIBLE to \"install bootmgr into MBR boot code\", see #5, #6, #7, #8 and #9\n\nNow I have read them carefully and even replied correctly to each of them, noting how 1/3 are duplicates/senseless, 1/3 are based on false base assumptions, the remaining 1/3 are about very basic mechanisms in the booting process, i.e. something that you should have already studied and fully understood.\n\nBesides the already mentioned site:\n\n[http://thestarman.pc.../mbr/index.html](http://thestarman.pcministry.com/asm/mbr/index.html \"External link\")\n\nMake sure to read additionally:\n\n[http://www.multibooters.co.uk/](http://www.multibooters.co.uk/ \"External link\")\n\n[http://diddy.boot-la...os/Grub4dos.htm](http://diddy.boot-land.net/grub4dos/Grub4dos.htm \"External link\")\n\nOnce you will have read thoroughly the above, you will have the needed understanding of the BIOS booting process, with particular reference to grub4dos and BOOTMGR, then read this site (the whole site AND links provided in it):\n\n[http://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/](http://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/ \"External link\")\n\nand you will have a fair idea of EFi/UEFI booting.\n\n![:duff:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/duff.gif)\n\nWonko\n\n"

      "content": "\u003e Why it might fail altogether ?\nThere are specifications: Unified Extensible Firmware Interface Specification.  \nAnd there are real world. A real world solution may expect one efi partition only.  \nOnly one have been tested. A EFI code may hang, given four efi partititons.  \nYou never know, only testing can answer this.  \n\nYou either keep a KISS priciple [http://en.wikipedia..../KISS_principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle \"External link\") and expect to work in a lot of cases.   \nOr you create a high sophisticated, experimental approach and test a lot.  \n\nContrary if different EFI works on demand, you may use this in another way.  \nPartition 1 bootloader: Windows 8 bootx64.efi - works at secure boot enabled or disable  \nPartition 2 bootloader: grub 2 bootx64.efi - works at secure boot disable  \n\n\u003e What it mean ? Does some UEFI firmware also look**\u0027ptn3\u0027** and **\u0027ptn4\u0027** for **\\\\EFI\\\\ Partition** ?  \n\u003e What If I put **\u0027EFI files\u0027** into all four partitions ( ptn1,ptn2,ptn3 and ptn4 ) ? Will it give sure UEFI booting ?\nAgain, unknown behaviour: may work or fail. Test yourself.  \nUEFI specification [http://www.uefi.org/](http://www.uefi.org/ \"External link\") refers four partition entries. A full implementation should read all four partitions.   \nUEFI specification primary partition explicitely.  \nYou may try logical partitions too. No, I won\u0027t try this.  \n\nBear in mind: there is no solution supporting your request: booting at all machines  \nThere are exceptions always.   \n"
