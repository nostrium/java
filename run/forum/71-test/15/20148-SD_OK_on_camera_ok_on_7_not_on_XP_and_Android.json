      "content": "Hi,\n\nBeen using this SD card 4GB Fat32\n\nwith my camera for a year or so.\n\nWas OK on my laptop (XP) until recently.\n\nNow, though the adapter (thumbsize USB) appears,\n\nand is recognized, there is no drive on XP.\n\nThis could be a driver problem, but the drive itself doesn\u0027t\n\nappear on a Disk tool on XP (HXD) as a physical drive.\n\nGrub4dos (from the HDD) doesn\u0027t see the physical drive either (hd1,0) (didn\u0027t try (hd1) though) (\"disk doesn\u0027t exist\").\n\nThe SD card also doesn\u0027t work on Android (tablet). Well in fact it appears, but 0 (zero) files.\n\nThe SD works \"perfectly\" with the camera, browsing or shooting.\n\nOn a Windows 7 it works OK too.\n\nIdeas welcome...\n\nPS, the XP computer is starting to be funny, although the SD not working on Android is strange.\n\nEdit: on a Win7 the same laptop model as the previous Win7 test (different computer), the SD appears for 1 second as E:.\n\nThen disappears. ![:unsure:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/unsure.png)\n\n"

(\"Be Gentle Though\")\n\n\"Please be aware that most internal PC digital contacts are gold plated.\"\n\nIf using an eraser, use the white erasers and not the pink ( \"too abrasive\" )\n\nsteel wool, gently rubbed, works well also.\n\nDo not get too aggressive, as the gold plating is very thin.\n\nGently wipe away eraser leftovers with alcohol swab or clean compressed air,\n\ndo not touch gold contacts with fingers or you will contaminate with oils.\n\nFor slotted/seated contacts like video cards and such,\n\nblow slots clean with compressed air, inspect contacts for damage,\n\nclean the edge connectors of the slotted card to be used here, like above.\n\nseat and reseat, mutiple times, the card to be used in that slot,\n\nremove card and inspect edge contacts under magnification for healthy connections.\n\nYou can easily identify suspected bad connection via the tracks and traces that the slot contacts scratch into the edge connector contacts.\n\nHappy troubleshooting.\n\nI would also check into your partitioning scheme.\n\nRegards\n\nRoyM\n\n"
