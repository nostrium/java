      "content": "Hi guys - I kept finding when googling for support that I would end up at this site so thought I might aswell post here!  \nI don\u0027t even remember half of the stuff I was trying last night - I fell asleep looking at isolinux.cfg files and such ![:(](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/sad.png)\n\nWhat I\u0027m trying to do is update my old multiboot USB that never worked well (most hyrens tools etc would fail to load, and the miniXP had no sata drivers so no local HDs)\n\n.\n\nWhat I have is old hyrens, new hyrens (working miniXP, yay), ophcrack 7 \\\u0026 xp, and konboot.\n\nI\u0027ve never done Linux stuff besides boot utils and I\u0027m new to the likes of konboot. All I want really is a bootable USB where I can run XP live for getting rid of persistently active malware outside the windows environment, ophcrack for forgotten passwords, and konboot for not needing to change them. I could make them all into separate USBs but I already have about 5 in my pocket the whole time and it\u0027s annoying!\n\nI\u0027ve had various problems whilst trying various setups - I\u0027ve used unetbootin, xboot, and stuff to try and get it working. Right now I\u0027ve got it so konboot works (after doing the drive-swap fix on this thread [http://reboot.pro/to...ot-not-working/](http://reboot.pro/topic/13700-kon-boot-not-working/ \"\")) and new hyrens runs miniXP but if I say DOSprograms it shows a bunch of stuff about disc info and then boots into windows. Old hyrens I think runs but also boots into windows if I try running anything.  \nIt\u0027s driving me mad and I figured someone might have premade menus/instructions for such a combination that works. I\u0027ve even had to hack the old hyren\u0027s ISO to take out minXP (not enough USB disk space!) and the new hyren\u0027s to add notepad in ![:o](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/ohmy.png)  \n\n"

Konboot I am not sure of never used it as it moved to shareware or something. Wonder does \u0027hyrens\u0027 mean \u0027Hiren\u0027s\u0027 CD but that boot clean from syslinux as an ISO even so can\u0027t be the same deal. Not sure which MiniXP you mean or how it\u0027s loaded, but all of those as far I can see together won\u0027t take more than 4GB USB stick, so, you sure most have damn small USB\u0027s at your pocket. MS-DOS again can be booted from 3 files and G4D in at hardware heck you don\u0027t even need to trouble with floppy images.\n\n"

I have used various tools like xboot and managed to shuffle the menu.lst files around a bit etc but I really know nothing about how it all works or the commands being used etc.\n\nI guess I made the mistake of thinking it would be simple to boot from separate ISO files (2 hirens, 2 ophcrack, 1 konboot) from 1 USB. All these tools to make it work yet I still get various problems.\n\nRight now konboot is working so I\u0027m reluctant to change anything there.\n\nThe hirens ones run but the old one ends up booting to HDD, the new one fails DOSprograms menu and boots to HDD, but at least the new one does run miniXP with full sata support etc.\n\nOPHcrack ones seem to work ok.\n\nMaybe I should use something other than xboot - which seems to load up the ISOs fine but for the hirens ones they go in as grub4dos emulation or something  \n\n"

      "content": "Hi guys\n\n@wonko - I am looking at rmprepusb and easy2boot now to see how it works out, since you have recommended it as xboot is deceased.\n\nLooking at passpass that looks good although it requires HDD modifications that need to be done, rebooted, used, rebooted, undone - whereas konboot\u0027s beauty is it just runs, boots, used, and then you turn off and walk away. I guess it\u0027s 2 different approaches but I think the easier one involving no mods and less reboot time is simpler?\n\n@genetix - you\u0027re right man I know very little about the inner workings of this stuff. I\u0027ve never used Linux or grub or anything so I\u0027m playing everything by ear and throwing random Linux commands at me doesn\u0027t mean anything sadly :tongue: I did actually use YUMI for my last multiboot USB but the problem was that even though it would boot things like hirens I found if I ran tools from within they would fail their linuxy type loading and I know nothing about linux to try and fix it - so they ended up just being used for miniXP which was outdated so didn\u0027t support SATA anyway.\n\nI guess in theory if I could build my own miniXP and get my own tools like ophcrack/konboot/ghost to work then I wouldn\u0027t need to combine all the stuff? But that is beyond my understanding so I leave it to you experts who\u0027ve been doing it and making tools for it for years :tongue:  \n\n"

This website is not related with Hiren.  \n\u003e\n\u003e We are aware the difficulties about finding and downloading a safe version of this BootCD and finding help about it. We hope this website to overcome these difficulties a little bit.  \n\u003e\n\u003e Donations made over the Donation link on this website directly goes to developer Hiren, we don\u0027t get anything from this donations.  \n\u003e\n\u003e To support high bandwidth usage, to keep this website alive and for giving a better service to you we only accept mirror servers as donation.\n\u003e\nEven the distribution is unofficial ![:w00t:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/w00t.gif) .\n\nAnd BTW, this is FAQ #3:\n\n\u003e Can you send a physical copy of the CD to my address?  \n\u003e\n\u003e Because of the problems related with slow download speeds, burning and etc. we are getting requests for sending a physical copy of the CD. Unfortunately we can\u0027t offer a that kind of help with or without a price.\n\u003e\nThe reasons why CD\u0027s are not directly sold by the officially unofficial site are not explained in detail, the poor guys on e-bay are offering a replacement service for a glitch in the officially unoffical distribution process, as I see it ![:innocent:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/innocent.gif).\n\n![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif)\n\nWonko\n\n"

It was annoying because most the stuff worked on its own but not combined - so it was mainly just used to run network ghost ...\n\nThat\u0027s why I\u0027m now trying to build something with newer tools/tutorials that will actually get stuff booting properly.\n\nYes hirens used to have illegal software included, but afaia it\u0027s all freeware/shareware on there now so it should be legit. Unless you\u0027re saying the PE environment you boot into isn\u0027t legal. But as much as you want to compare me to someone who litters, or steals - the fact is if I can boot something working that uses someone elses key when I already have my own key then the only legal technicality is my lack of changing a key in a file somewhere and not even MS cares about that. Also phone them if you want and you will basically get told to do what you want with XP (I have had them say this) because they don\u0027t care and about to pull the plug anyways. However I saw some \u0027DLV\u0027 version of hirens around the place in my research the last 2 days, saying mini win7? That would obviously be straight up on the highly illegal chart for MS as they are actively against pirating of their actual sold software (XP isn\u0027t sold - it\u0027s abandonware).\n\nEitherway I\u0027m not endorsing piracy but if my mate runs a cake shop and says I can have a cake for free cos he isn\u0027t going to sell it or lets me use his oven for free cos he has a new one, then I\u0027m not going to argue against him :tongue:\n\nIf I dare get back on topic ............. the easy2boot stuff seemed to work well - my notes from before work say \"konboot should move to main menu, new hirens ISO needs to appear main menu (old hirens extracted seems ok), Ophcrack can lose the \\\u003c512m slow option\"\n\n"

      "content": "Hi guys\n\n@wonko - I am looking at rmprepusb and easy2boot now to see how it works out, since you have recommended it as xboot is deceased.\n\nLooking at passpass that looks good although it requires HDD modifications that need to be done, rebooted, used, rebooted, undone - whereas konboot\u0027s beauty is it just runs, boots, used, and then you turn off and walk away. I guess it\u0027s 2 different approaches but I think the easier one involving no mods and less reboot time is simpler?\n\n@genetix - you\u0027re right man I know very little about the inner workings of this stuff. I\u0027ve never used Linux or grub or anything so I\u0027m playing everything by ear and throwing random Linux commands at me doesn\u0027t mean anything sadly :tongue: I did actually use YUMI for my last multiboot USB but the problem was that even though it would boot things like hirens I found if I ran tools from within they would fail their linuxy type loading and I know nothing about linux to try and fix it - so they ended up just being used for miniXP which was outdated so didn\u0027t support SATA anyway.\n\nI guess in theory if I could build my own miniXP and get my own tools like ophcrack/konboot/ghost to work then I wouldn\u0027t need to combine all the stuff? But that is beyond my understanding so I leave it to you experts who\u0027ve been doing it and making tools for it for years :tongue:  \n\n"

The reason is that MS are the owners of the software and they simply don\u0027t care about XP! Many small shops in many countries openly sell PCs with hacked copies of XP and MS do nothing to prosecute them. In addition, **Hirens CDs are openly for sale on eBay** .

It was annoying because most the stuff worked on its own but not combined - so it was mainly just used to run network ghost ...\n\nThat\u0027s why I\u0027m now trying to build something with newer tools/tutorials that will actually get stuff booting properly.\n\nYes hirens used to have illegal software included, but afaia it\u0027s all freeware/shareware on there now so it should be legit. Unless you\u0027re saying the PE environment you boot into isn\u0027t legal. But as much as you want to compare me to someone who litters, or steals - the fact is if I can boot something working that uses someone elses key when I already have my own key then the only legal technicality is my lack of changing a key in a file somewhere and not even MS cares about that. Also phone them if you want and you will basically get told to do what you want with XP (I have had them say this) because they don\u0027t care and about to pull the plug anyways. However I saw some \u0027DLV\u0027 version of hirens around the place in my research the last 2 days, saying mini win7? That would obviously be straight up on the highly illegal chart for MS as they are actively against pirating of their actual sold software (XP isn\u0027t sold - it\u0027s abandonware).\n\nEitherway I\u0027m not endorsing piracy but if my mate runs a cake shop and says I can have a cake for free cos he isn\u0027t going to sell it or lets me use his oven for free cos he has a new one, then I\u0027m not going to argue against him :tongue:\n\nIf I dare get back on topic ............. the easy2boot stuff seemed to work well - my notes from before work say \"konboot should move to main menu, new hirens ISO needs to appear main menu (old hirens extracted seems ok), Ophcrack can lose the \\\u003c512m slow option\"\n\n"

Any thoughts? :/ Oh yeah I put the recovery console entry in there I found online but looks like I need a lot of work to use that and need to acquire the actual \u0027image\u0027 to boot\n\n```\ncolor cyan/black black/white light-blue/black white/light-cyan\ntimeout 10\ndefault 1\n\nwrite (md)0x220+1 !BAT\\necho -n -P:0000 $[0133]                    --- MULTIBOOT MENU ---                          index\u003d     \\0\ninitscript (md)0x220+1\n\ntitle ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿\nroot\n\ntitle ³  1 Continue booting HDD normally                  ³\nchainloader (hd1)+1\nrootnoverify (hd1)\n\n\ntitle ³  2 Hiren\u0027s Boot CD 15.2 --- MINI WINDOWS XP       ³\n/QRUN.g4b ()/images/HirensISO.isowinvh\nboot\n\n\ntitle ³  3 Hiren\u0027s Boot CD 10.5 --- DOS PROGRAMS          ³\nfind --set-root /HBCD/menu.lst\nconfigfile /HBCD/menu.lst\n\n\ntitle ³  4 KonBoot 2.1 Full                               ³\nerrorcheck off\nmap --mem /images/konboot/konboot.img (fd0)\ncheckrange 0x80 read 0x8280 \u0026\u0026 map (hd0) (hd1)\ncheckrange 0x80 read 0x8280 \u0026\u0026 map (hd1) (hd0)\nmap --hook\nchainloader (fd0)+1\nrootnoverify (fd0)\n\n\ntitle ³  5 OPHcrack                                       ³\nkernel /images/ophcrack/boot/bzImage rw root\u003d/dev/null vga\u003dnormal lang\u003dC kmap\u003duk screen\u003d1024x768x16 autologin\ninitrd /images/ophcrack/boot/rootfs.gz\n\n\ntitle ³  6 Windows 98 SE Floppy Disk                      ³\n/QRUN.g4b ()/images/Windows98_SE.img\nboot\n\n\ntitle ³  7 Freedos Boot Disk                              ³\n/QRUN.g4b ()/images/freedosbalder10.img\nboot\n\n\ntitle ³  8 Windows NT/2K/XP Recovery Console              ³\nfind --set-root /cmldr\nchainloader /cmldr\n# write string \"cmdcons\" to memory 0000:7C03 in 2 steps:\n# step 1.

I\u0027ve delved around various menus and config.sys and dosimg.gz type files etc but not got it sorted :\\| It would save a load of space and a menu entry if I could. I found on a \u0027custom menu\u0027 in dos menus some ghost entries but when ghost finally appears it gives \"bad block\" error and quits.\n\nAs for the ghost32 in minixp, that runs and gives the same bad block error and quits. It seems to be the same error as here\n\n[http://reboot.pro/to...-multiboot-usb/](http://reboot.pro/topic/17495-error-bad-blocks-when-starting-ghost-solution-from-multiboot-usb/ \"\")\n\nbut all the image size/hex stuff there is beyond me.\n\nFor the record, this is an extracted hirens 15.2 now running off the usb - not the iso (because I hope to get rid of old hirens extracted so don\u0027t need new hirens to use iso)  \nJust extracted ghost32.exe to the minixp desktop and ran it and got this error in the ghosterr.txt for anyone who might understand it better?

It thinks the last sector is 31883264.\n\nIf you run RMPrepUSB and do a **DiskInfo**it will tell you the size of the device.\n\nAlso, you can hit Ctrl-D to invoke **DiskDoctor**. The correct USB drive number will automatically be selected.\n\nNote the you should see Start (\u003d**0** ) and No. Sectors (should be about **31883265**).\n\nChange the Start value to 31883263 and change the No Sectors to 1 - then click on the Sequential Read button - you should not get an error.\n\nThen change No. Sectors to 2 - should also be OK\n\nThen change No. Sectors to 3 - may fail\n\nBe careful when using DiskDoctor - drive 0 will be your internal hard disk and of you select Drive 0 and click one of the red buttons it will write junk all over your system disk! (you will be warned first though).\n\n"

Ok. 3 - error as you predicted :\n\u003e\n\u003e Reading 3 sectors starting at LBA 31883262 on drive 1  \n\u003e Error Reading Sector 31883262 for 3 sectors.\n\nSo it would seem that 31883264 IS unreadable. Not sure why ghost is trying to access a sector beyond the size of the drive???\n\nNot sure why this would cause ghost to bomb out though as I would have thought it would just give an error message but allow you to backup/restore still....?\n\nCan you try another USB drive?\n\n"

I think it said it would do that for flat directorys and ramdisks but not if you use the ISO? Or maybe I\u0027m confusing things. But that would certainly be a good reason to use the ISO method!  \nSo right now I have the ISO and the flatfile and will need to reread through those threads until I can get one working - preferably one that won\u0027t nuke my USB with disk commands!\n\nI also have the ghost32 which I just tried on my other usb just booting hirens 15.2 iso to minixp and running it directly and it doesn\u0027t error or give problems. So the badblock thing is only on the other USB. Hmmm :/ Definitely need sleep ...\n\n"
