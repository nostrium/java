I also found this EWF Manager [https://www.microsof...s.aspx?id\u003d27587](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id\u003d27587 \"External link\") and wondered if I could use that to set it up, rather than finding out Disk Signatures and Partition Offsets and hand writing reg files?\n\n"

      "content": "There was a program i used that would automatically set the offsets and such.  \nAdditionally I used EWF on a full blown install, which worked great....until I ran out of RAM. No warnings, just BSOD.  \nEven set up a service to run ewfmgr /commit on every boot...even before windows update started. but alot of updates wont work through ewf.  \n\nI will see if I can find that application and i will get back with you.\n\n"
