WinBuilder starts the Qemu, but afterwards you can only see the mouse pointer and thats it. Theres a box flashing and I can read that it says something about XPE or XPE Installation, or XPE Loading on its TitleBar with Windows XP logo below the TitleBar... Loaded it to a Flashdrive to see if it works but I get the same thing... Are there any required prerequisites, system requirements, etc, etc needed for it to run? RAM or something?\n\n"
