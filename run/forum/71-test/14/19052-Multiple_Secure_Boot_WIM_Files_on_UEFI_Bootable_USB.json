      "content": "I\u0027ve looked around on the forums and while I\u0027ve found plenty of tutorials on making Multi Boot USB that are UEFI ready, what I am after is slightly different.\n\nI have a NTFS 64GB flash drive I currently use to boot Legacy systems with utilities such as WinRE, Acronis, Paragon, etc. These I created using EasyBCD which was easy enough.\n\nNow, I have another 64GB flash drive that I have formatted as FAT32 and currently it boots into Acronis using UEFI Secure Boot.\n\nI want to add more to the boot entries so my other WIM files which are UEFI ready, can be booted. However, when I try and add them using EasyBCD it always reverts to adding them as MBR/Legacy and does not use winload.efi in the boot entry but instead uses winload.exe which forces the image to boot into Legacy Mode. With UEFI Secure Boot on, this causes the machine to just sit at a black screen.\n\nIs there a command or way to add more entries but have them use winload.efi? I\u0027ve searched high and low (to the best of my knowledge) but I saw allot of Multi Boot/UEFI (No mention of Secure Boot which is a requirement)\n\nAny help is most appreciated.\n\n"
