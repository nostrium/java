      "content": "JFYI, it usually works the other way round.\n\nFirst you make a working Live CD, and then you find a way to load it from USB.,\n\nYou won\u0027t normally want to boot an \"XP\" as LiveCD (though it is possible it has a set of limitations), you want to male a PE (PE 1.x) based on your Windows install CD.\n\nA suitable project to begin with is UBCD4WIN:\n\n[http://www.ubcd4win.com/](http://www.ubcd4win.com/ \"External link\")\n\nwhich is a particular version largely pre-configured of a BartPE.\n\nAn alternative is LiveXP, you may want to start with amalux\u0027s \"simplified\" and \"frozen\" builds:\n\n[http://reboot.pro/to...-portable-apps/](http://reboot.pro/topic/4111-newcomers-tutorial-livexp-win7pe-portable-apps/ \"\")\n\n![:cheers:](https://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif)\n\nWonko\n\n"
