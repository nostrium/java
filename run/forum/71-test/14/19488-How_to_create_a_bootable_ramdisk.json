It is an image of a disk held in RAM!  \nThe image needs to be loaded from somewhere when the computer starts, as RAM forgets all of it\u0027s contents on shutdown or reboot.  \n\nbtw. What you call a \u0027bootable ramdisk\u0027 sounds more like a \u0027reset proof ramdisk\u0027 a ramdisk which does not forget it\u0027s contents upon a reboot, just at shutdown.   \n(Still the image needs to be loaded from somewhere.)  \n\n![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif)   \n"

In fact, if it was lost, the early CPUs could not switch back from protected mode to real mode as the only way they could do it was to reset the CPU and then jump to a vector in RAM to another part of the OS which is still in RAM.\n\n"

Is that even possible?  \nSounds kinda crazy but it would be nice if this could be possible.\n\nâ€‹English is not my first language so I hope you can understand what I want to do.
