Please check your parameters and try again.\n\nI\u0027ve tried multiple .iso extensions all resulting in the same error.\n\nWe were able to find a work-around, however it reduces the usability of the drive to a single distro installation.\n\nExtracting from:\n\n[http://iniu.net/cont...econd-harddisk/](http://iniu.net/content/how-install-oracle-enterprise-linux-61-usb-second-harddisk/ \"External link\")  \nCopy the downloaded Oracle Enterprise linux ISO file to the USB flash  \nCopy the \u0027images\u0027 folder to the usb flash  \nCopy file \u0027initrd.img\u0027 and \u0027vmlinuz\u0027 (under the \u0027isolinux\u0027 folder) to the root of the usb flash\n\nThat means, I now have the iso on there twice and the other files, which are specific to that distro.\n\nIs this something solved by a custom menu or setting that I\u0027m missing?\n\nThanks\n\n**Edited by wanman, 13 November 2013 - 05:27 PM.**\n"

      "content": "Modifying the ISO seems crud since we\u0027re talking about something as common as CentOS and OEL which are just dirivitives of RedHat.\n\nJust to clarify... on booting the USB, the ISO loads find, starts the install and one of the early questions is where to find the installation media. At that point, I get a standard list of all the identified partitions, and as recommended I pick /dev/sda4. All of the other partiions immediately fail, but sda4 proceeds with starting the installation. It\u0027s diring the installation is when it does the \u0027examining storage devices\u0027 that it decides it can no longer find the files it needs on sda4.\n\nThanks\n\n"

At start of Anaconda, select the partition holding the ISO file and type in the field below the directory name holding the ISO image.\n\nRef:\n\n[https://fedoraprojec...naconda/Options](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Anaconda_Boot_Options?rd\u003dAnaconda/Options \"External link\")\n\n[http://fedoraproject...ckstart#install](http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Anaconda/Kickstart#install \"External link\")\n\n[https://fedoraprojec...lation_problems](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/How_to_debug_installation_problems \"External link\")\n\nNTFS seems not supported, that\u0027s quite rare for the end of year 2013, ISO is too big for FAT32.\n\nQuick glance at the log files, anaconda stage 1 finds and uses the isohybrid partition /dev/sdX4, stage 2 is where it fails.\n\nThere should be much better approach- netinst ISO and repos/images elsewhere, if netinst have the same functionality.\n\nTrying Oracle now, smaller ISO will fit on FAT32, will update posts with results.\n\n**Added:**\n\nOracle Linux did work. Using 6.4 i386 DVD (V37085-01.iso) on FAT32, images directory copied inside /ISO/ directory, where the ISO file is as well, at start of installer typed ISO and selected /dev/sda1. Currently it\u0027s at \\~60% of installing packages stage.\n\nDrawback- another ISO of this type must go in another directory, to be accompanied by different /images directory.\n\n"
