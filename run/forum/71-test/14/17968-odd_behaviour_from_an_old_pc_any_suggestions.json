I expect that you will gain some valuable experience by using these, as they very often come in handy.\n\nIf you have a spare USB storage device whose data can be completely lost/erased, then yes, I\u0027d advise using that spare and simply writing the diagnostic MBR code to it. If you are thinking about changing the MBR code for a USB storage device with valuable data on it, you ++must++ backup that MBR, first. Otherwise, you could live to regret it. Also: Make sure that backup is ++not on the USB storage device, itself++! It should be backed up elsewhere.\n\n\u003e Once I get this working, I\u0027ll be able to tell how I should format my flashdrive for it to be recognized?\n\nPossibly. But if it turns out that your BIOS has a maximum C/H/S that truncates the device, then that BIOS has a limitation and you might have better results by using **PLoP**.\n\n\u003e I realize I am sort of a noob around here and I apologize for the time wasted because of this.\n\n\"C/H/S geometry\" are three numbers which basically state how large the device is. They would be most useful for reporting here, at this point. Then someone can multiply them and tell you how large BIOS thinks the USB storage device is.\n\n"

It may be listed in the booting devices, whether as HDD (as any other HDD you may have) or as some USB device. If the BIOS recognizes it (I mean, not by trying to boot the device, but by being listed somewhere in your BIOS, as a potential bootable device for example), then look at the size the BIOS informs about it. Is it the full size (or at least approximately the full size)?\n\nIf you can see your USB drive from Win7, can\u0027t you use RMPrepUSB to clean it, test it, add a boot code, partition it and format it?

We see that BIOS is capable of **LBA** , beyond the usual **C/H/S** addressing capabilities. We see that **954** cylinders x **255** heads x **63** sectors-per-track \u003d **15326010** sectors. That many sectors times **512** bytes-per-sector \u003d **7846917120** bytes. That is about **7.308 GiB** . That means that the BIOS appears to be fully capable of addressing the entire device. That means that your original problem is not likely related to BIOS nor to the age of the computer. Great work! ![:good:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/good.gif)\n\nHaving established that, perhaps we could move on to: How are you partitioning the USB storage device (what command, tool, interface, etc.)? If I understand your problem correctly, your complaint is that partitions greater than **2 GB** in size do not seem to be bootable. Can you please share a bit about what you\u0027ve tried and what you\u0027ve observed, when you\u0027ve tried to create and to boot a partition that\u0027s greater than 2 GB?\n\n"

That means that the BIOS appears to be fully capable of addressing the entire device.\n\nThe value we get out of this is 7.308 because this is (aprox) the cappacity of my usb device: it can access the entire drive. Do I understand correctly?\n\nWhat is we\u0027d get this value, while using a usb device with a capacity of 20GB? Then there would have been a limitation, wouldn\u0027t there?\n\n\u003e I\u0027d suggest using the **HP USB Disk Storage Format Tool**\n\nI used the HP USB format tool before, but never succeeded in creating a boot-able msdos drive before.\n\nOdd enough, today it succeeded on first try , I used a FAT32 parition with a size of 7.3 GiB. (according to windows that is).\n\nI guess now I could just copy the xp installation over and start winnt.exe in dos?\n\nPerhaps the 2G limit was caused by the programs I used or something.\n\nWhat if for some weird reason I would like the device to be formatted in FAT16?

The **Windows XP** installation process does not expect the installation files to be on a USB flash storage device. It might not load drivers for USB storage, so the USB device might be inaccessible by the installation process. You can modify the installation files to modify this behaviour; fairly old news, but you\u0027d need to read all about it.\n\n\u003e Perhaps the 2G limit was caused by the programs I used or something.\n\nPossibly!\n\n\u003e What if for some weird reason I would like the device to be formatted in FAT16?

However, what I was trying to ask: how would I make a bootable ms-dos usb device in FAT16? Since the HP tool will not doe it, because the partition needs to be smaller than the full capacity of the device.\n\nLike I said: this is a question only out of curiosity, FAT32 works a treat.\n\n\u003e Not really.

Any good pages on how to do this? I thought Nlite was capable of doing something like this, but I can\u0027t seem to find it in the program, perhaps I\u0027m mistaking.\n\n"
