      "content": "Well, if you installed windows and it deleted the secondary partition you need some sort of recover tool to get it back, data is still there. In any case of direct USB installation of Windows OS, if there would be secondary partitions and you would format first partition all second partition infos will be cleaned out.\n\nFastest you get that information and you are able to recover would be some free recover tool (there are more advanced ones, but you probably won\u0027t need them on this situation). Something like Partition Wizard 8 would probably even do. Just install it under \u0027Wizard\u0027 \\\u003e \u0027Partition Recover Wizard\u0027 \\\u003e do a quick scan on about 20480 sectors after the space windows formatted and you most likely find the partition to recover which windows misplaced (Assuming my explained above case is correct). If not do quick scan on full drive until you find the partition(s) you\u0027ve lost (because there is backup mbr on end of drive, if the partition was on start of the drive and that table is corrupted or bad right now) .\n\n**Edited by genetix, 21 August 2013 - 10:35 PM.**\n"
