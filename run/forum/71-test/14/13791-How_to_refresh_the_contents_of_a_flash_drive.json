This is done by evaluating time-to-failure under high  \n\u003e temperature stress.\n\nIn a nutshell, a mathematical model BTW calculated taking as base a non-better defined \"empirical value\" is applied, and **SINCE** the result of this (supposedly accurate ![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif)) model results in a \"Typical value\" **ALWAYS** \\\u003e 100 years (which is a non-value, 101, 1000, 10000 and 100000, as well 1 zillion years ![:w00t:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/w00t.gif) do fall in the categorization) **THEN** a guaranteed 10 years is given.  \n\n![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif)  \nWonko   \n"

      "content": "I have had a few emails from Kingston trying to get a clear answer and almost succeeded (!), here are the Q\u0027s I asked and Kingston\u0027s response:  \n\nWhich of these would refresh the memory for another 10 years (say)?   \n1. Just plug into a 5V USB port and leave it for a while (I assume no refresh would occur)  \n2. Plug into a computer and read all sectors on the drive (I assume no refresh would occur)  \n3. Plug into a computer and read and then write back all sectors on the drive (I assume this would refresh)  \nA side question is,   \n4. If a flash memory was filled with important data and then from that date on, it was only read/accessed by a computer but never re-written, would the 10 years (or whatever the data retention spec. says) for the drive still apply. i.e. does the data retention period apply for unpowered flash, powered flash and read-only flash memory (or even, is the data retention period actually shorter if the cells are read a lot during the 10 years, and if so, by how much is the data retention period shortened)?   \n(in particular I would like to know if constant read access to cells could lead to their loss of charge and if so by how much -- i.e. negligible or shorten data renetion by 50%)   \n\ni.e. if I constantly read Kingston flash memory as fast as I could for 3 years (with no writes) would you still \u0027guarantee\u0027 the data would be intact after 3 years?   \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n\u003e Kingstons response was : The customers response is correct for points 1-4.   \n\u003e Utilizing the drive as a read-only device would reduce any likelyhood of an uncorrectable error occuring, however, a unrecoverable data integrity error would have a near impossible likelyhood to occur even within the products guaranteed life-time configured as a read/write device. SSDs implement multiple fail-safes via detecting and correction methods to ensure that an uncorrectable error does not occur even beyond the products life-time. Hard drives also feature error correcting features since they are suspectible to the same laws of physics that apply to any other storage device.   \n\u003e\n\u003e There is no guarantee on data integrity as there is no standard to measure data integrity on SSDs for archival purposes by which we could test the product by. No storage device manufacturer offers a guarantee that guarantees data integrity on SSDs. Since there is no extensive proof from studies on the degradation of charge in a NAND Flash device there is no way to easily extrapolate the integrity expectancy, however, there are investigations underway to enhance and retrieve further information in this field via the IEEE and other communities.   \n\u003e\n\u003e Our current generation of SSDs are not meant for archival purposes but as performance upgrade solutions.   \n\u003e\n\u003e AND  \n\u003e\n\u003e Flash products built by Kingston are not built for archival purposes but if they are used in this capacity the best way to ensure the data integrity is maintained throughout the life-time of the product is to read all the data off the drive, perform a HDDErase cycle to clear all blocks and lastly, rewrite all the data back to the drive.   \n\u003e\n\u003e Unfortunately there is little information available from studies into this field to decisively state the exact frequency that this should be done since the error correction capability varies between the various NAND flash mediums and their featured controllers/software. There on-going discussions by IEEE and various standards groups to enhance and study this field further.   \n\u003e\n\u003e Hard disk drive manufacturer readily recommend performing a read and re-write on their hard disk drives every 3 years for archival purposes and I would suggest doing the same with NAND flash based products, even when the contents of the stated NAND flash based products are not modified by a read-erase-write cycle.  \n\u003e\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nSo, I take it from this response that if reading flash memory causes a CRC error to be detected then the flash controller would probably re-allocate the page if it could (???) or at least fix it with ECC so the data is not corrupt. However, I would question whether ECC correction is relevant for flash memory as ECC works for small runs of bad bits (e.g. as with a damaged hard disk sector), whereas flash memory cells (like CCDs in cameras) would just have bad cells at \u0027random\u0027 places within a page??? So ECC would in practice only be good for single bit errors?  \n\nAt least this goes some way to answering the OP\u0027s question though...  \n\nSo how long before someone writes a \u0027Flash drive refresh program\u0027 and would it work if the drive had intelligent caching (as it would not bother to actually do a read/erase/write cycle if you wrote the same data back) and how could you check if it actually had done a r/e/w cycle anyway? Hence, I guess, the Kingston guys recommending an HDDErase cycle? ![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif)   \n\nAnswers on a postcard to ... (here!)   \n"

Just plug into a 5V USB port and leave it for a while (I assume no refresh would occur)  \n2. Plug into a computer and read all sectors on the drive (I assume no refresh would occur)  \n3. Plug into a computer and read and then write back all sectors on the drive (I assume this would refresh)  \nA side question is,   \n4. If a flash memory was filled with important data and then from that date on, it was only read/accessed by a computer but never re-written, would the 10 years (or whatever the data retention spec. says) for the drive still apply. i.e. does the data retention period apply for unpowered flash, powered flash and read-only flash memory (or even, is the data retention period actually shorter if the cells are read a lot during the 10 years, and if so, by how much is the data retention period shortened)?   \n(in particular I would like to know if constant read access to cells could lead to their loss of charge and if so by how much -- i.e. negligible or shorten data renetion by 50%)   \n\ni.e. if I constantly read Kingston flash memory as fast as I could for 3 years (with no writes) would you still \u0027guarantee\u0027 the data would be intact after 3 years?   \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n\u003e Kingstons response was : The customers response is correct for points 1-4.   \n\u003e Utilizing the drive as a read-only device would reduce any likelyhood of an uncorrectable error occuring, however, a unrecoverable data integrity error would have a near impossible likelyhood to occur even within the products guaranteed life-time configured as a read/write device. SSDs implement multiple fail-safes via detecting and correction methods to ensure that an uncorrectable error does not occur even beyond the products life-time. Hard drives also feature error correcting features since they are suspectible to the same laws of physics that apply to any other storage device.   \n\u003e\n\u003e There is no guarantee on data integrity as there is no standard to measure data integrity on SSDs for archival purposes by which we could test the product by. No storage device manufacturer offers a guarantee that guarantees data integrity on SSDs. Since there is no extensive proof from studies on the degradation of charge in a NAND Flash device there is no way to easily extrapolate the integrity expectancy, however, there are investigations underway to enhance and retrieve further information in this field via the IEEE and other communities.   \n\u003e\n\u003e Our current generation of SSDs are not meant for archival purposes but as performance upgrade solutions.   \n\u003e\n\u003e AND  \n\u003e\n\u003e Flash products built by Kingston are not built for archival purposes but if they are used in this capacity the best way to ensure the data integrity is maintained throughout the life-time of the product is to read all the data off the drive, perform a HDDErase cycle to clear all blocks and lastly, rewrite all the data back to the drive.   \n\u003e\n\u003e Unfortunately there is little information available from studies into this field to decisively state the exact frequency that this should be done since the error correction capability varies between the various NAND flash mediums and their featured controllers/software. There on-going discussions by IEEE and various standards groups to enhance and study this field further.   \n\u003e\n\u003e Hard disk drive manufacturer readily recommend performing a read and re-write on their hard disk drives every 3 years for archival purposes and I would suggest doing the same with NAND flash based products, even when the contents of the stated NAND flash based products are not modified by a read-erase-write cycle.  \n\u003e\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nSo, I take it from this response that if reading flash memory causes a CRC error to be detected then the flash controller would probably re-allocate the page if it could (???) or at least fix it with ECC so the data is not corrupt. However, I would question whether ECC correction is relevant for flash memory as ECC works for small runs of bad bits (e.g. as with a damaged hard disk sector), whereas flash memory cells (like CCDs in cameras) would just have bad cells at \u0027random\u0027 places within a page??? So ECC would in practice only be good for single bit errors?  \n\nAt least this goes some way to answering the OP\u0027s question though...  \n\nSo how long before someone writes a \u0027Flash drive refresh program\u0027 and would it work if the drive had intelligent caching (as it would not bother to actually do a read/erase/write cycle if you wrote the same data back) and how could you check if it actually had done a r/e/w cycle anyway? Hence, I guess, the Kingston guys recommending an HDDErase cycle? ![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif)   \n\nAnswers on a postcard to ... (here!)   \n"

It is easier to use a test pattern rather than the original data.\n\nYou can well insert - between steps #2 and #3 two passes, one with 55AA\u0027s and one with AA55\u0027s (or one with 55\u0027s and one with AA\u0027s), in order to flip at bit level.\n\nWe would need someone that actually writes an ALL55 (and ALLAA or a ALL55AA, and ALLAA55) MD5 generator, see semi-random idea proposed in this seemingly (actually :wink:) unrelated topic:\n\n[http://www.forensicf...opic/p\u003d6569139/](http://www.forensicfocus.com/Forums/viewtopic/p\u003d6569139/ \"External link\")\n\n![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif)\n\nWonko\n\n"
