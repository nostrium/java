      "content": "Hi,  \nI am new to using EFI. I will highly appreciate if someone can help me out to resolve this issue.  \n\n1. I built a kernel image for x86_64 arch by enabling the EFI options in the config file. Also disabled the AGP options.  \n2. Downloaded elilo_x86_64.efi file version 3.10. Made a 2 GB pen drive as FAT32. Copied this elilo.efi file onto USB. Made elilo.conf file on USB. Copied this kernel image onto USB and made its entry in the conf file. When I invoke this elilo.efi file from EFI shell, screen displays \"Elilo Boot:.........\" and the system reboots itself. I also tried bzImage but the behaviour was same. When i provide initrd image, its gets loaded correctly displaying \"Loading initrd............done\" and after that the system reboots. Kindly help me out how to resolve this.  \n3.As this did not work, I downloaded GRUB2 source code and compiled for --platform\u003defi and --arch\u003dx86_64. Then I installed this grub on the USB. Then I copied the kernel image on USB and made grub.cfg file by using grub-mkconfig. Now when i Invoke grub.efi from the EFI shell, I am able to see the menu listing all the entries. When I select any entry, screen displays \"error:no suitable mode found  \nBooting anyhow\" message on the screen and the system gets hung. I read on internet and thought that we need to mention insmod efi_gop and efi_uga in the grub.cfg file but how to generate and use unicode.pf2 file, I did not understand.I would appreciate if i get to know what steps are to be followed for resolving this error.   \n"
