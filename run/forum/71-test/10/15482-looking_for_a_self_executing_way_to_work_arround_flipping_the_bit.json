Im starting to think its a myth except for the CDFS type like U3 and such.  \ncan I hz a work arround please!  \nthanks   \n"

Wonko, we obviously have different philosophies on what a \"myth\" is.. mine is that it cant be proven one way or the other, yours seems to be a myth is a lie. I have found evidence that there are indeed flipable bit flashdrives but Ive also found evidence that THOR exsists.. so until I can see beyond 3D or flip a bit its still all a myth.I havnt given up! but when I \"know\" from experience that a bit is flipable then it will be truth but until then it remains a myth. (from my perspective)thanks\\\u003c/p\\\u003e   \n"
