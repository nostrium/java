      "content": "You seem like not having fully grasped the idea of the \"Universal XP\".  \nIt is not actually as much a \"universal XP\" as it is a \"learning XP\".  \nI.e. it will \"learn\" new hardware each time you boot it on new, different hardware.  \nAs such it will tend to \"grow\" in size.  \nNo problems that I know of by slipstreaming SP3, and RyanVM, all you will have at the end of them will be an updated source.  \nOnce you have the updated source, it\u0027s all right to add drivers, via DriverPacks or otherways.  \n\nBut if you are looking for fast booting it is not IMHO the best choice.  \nIt all depends on WHAT is the use of such a build, on a \"full XP\" (universal of not) you have heaps of bloatware that you will probably never use and that add to size and - even if not directly - to boot times (with new ditrect mapping features this has been reduced as the thingy is not anymore loadeed in RAM)  \n\nA PE is more limited but usually smaller (please read as faster booting), additionally nothing prevents you (both with XP and with a PE) to divide the build in a very small \"core\" and have all the rest in another image and using junction points if needed or simply having all the apps in the other mounted image.  \n\nThe option of booting a .iso through grub4dos without --mem mapping has been an option since the very first releases, the only rquirement is that the .iso is contiguous.  \n\nBut still it won\u0027t work for a PE .iso (or for a .img) without some dedicated virtual disk driver added to the build (firadisk or winvblock) or using the now \"old\" ramdisk.sys form Windows 2003 SP! approach.  \n\nCompare with:  \n\u003chttp://reboot.pro/8944/\u003e  \n\n![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif)  \nWonko   \n"

      "content": "\u003e JFYI, and as general advice, it is meaningless to post a report of an EFFECT without posting WHAT EXACT commands/settings/whatever you are experimenting with.\nI did not said because it was defualt commands of Wimb\u0027s IMG_XP  \n\n\u003e but if you properly read the link I pointed you to\nyes I didn\u0027t see this  \n\u003e is set to subfolders of C:\\\\D\n\u003e By the way I can only suggest you have a look at Readme_POST_FIX.txt in the the POST_FIX folder of Wimb\u0027s tools, there is some very useful info there.\nthanks they were useful  \n\nfinally I found the problem  \ncause was NTFS Compresstion. as you see in last image of post #10 size of xp-1.img on disk is 832kb and this file is between other files of disk so if img wants to grow up it should be fragmented  \nI had disabled Compresstion and after some defragmenting problem solved  \nand now I have installed XP and EWF and DevPath.exe are working good but when I want to boot img from my usb I recive 7b stop message  \nI just added Chipset + CPU + Lan + MassStorage drivers with DriverPacks  \nand did not pressed F6 to Load Drivers  \nalso I ca\u0027t understand this steps in Source Preparation so I didn\u0027t do them  \n\u003e Supports the use of BTS DriverPacks located in OEM Folder on USB-Drive  \n\u003e [http://driverpacks.net/downloads](http://driverpacks.net/downloads \"External link\")  \n\u003e For Install of XP on a modern system with SATA Drives it is needed to use DPsBase.exe  \n\u003e for Integrating in your XPSOURCE BTS DriverPack Massstorage with TXT Mode Enabled.  \n\u003e In that case a lot of Extra RAID SCSI and SATA Drivers (about 120 extra) are Integrated which appear in the  \n\u003e XP Setup BootFolder $WIN_NT$.\\~BT on Install-Drive and can prevent a lot of XP Install Boot Problems.  \n\u003e It will be useful to Add also Chipset, CPU and LAN DriverPack, which are small so that  \n\u003e the decompression at the beginning of GUI-mode of XP Setup does NOT take to much time.  \n\u003e Always first use RyanVM Integrator or nLite and then use DPsBase to Improve your XP-Source.  \n\u003e The program supplies a Customised presetup.cmd and changes the winnt.sif file for use of DriverPacks.  \n\u003e\n\u003e When you don\u0027t use nLite, you can copy the supplied $OEM$ folder to your XP Source folder.  \n\u003e Change $OEM$ folder to your needs for UserAccounts and Registry Tweaks and Adding Drivers.  \n\u003e CMDLINES.TXT is used for making UserAccounts and install of Registry Tweaks at T-12  \n\u003e Info see: [http://unattended.ms.../unattended.xp/](http://unattended.msfn.org/unattended.xp/ \"External link\")  \n\u003e\n\u003e PnP Drivers specified in winnt.sif can be added to $OEM$\\\\$1\\\\Drivers  \n\u003e [http://unattended.ms...xp/view/web/34/](http://unattended.msfn.org/unattended.xp/view/web/34/ \"External link\")  \n\u003e TEXTMODE Drivers defined in winnt.sif and located in $OEM$\\\\TEXTMODE folder of the XP Source  \n\u003e can be used instead of using F6 floppy for MassStorage Drivers.  \n\u003e The content of the $OEM$\\\\TEXTMODE folder is copied by USB_XP_Setup.exe to XP Setup BootFolder $WIN_NT$.\\~BT\\\\$OEM$\n![:good:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/good.gif)   \n"

      "content": "\u003e and now I have installed XP and EWF and DevPath.exe are working good but when I want to boot img from my usb I recive 7b stop message  \nIf you use Wimb\u0027s tools, presumably the whole thing relies on WinVBlock, right ?  \n\nIn this case, there is a possibility that things don\u0027t work and you get a BSOD 7B. It may work on some hardware, and not on some other. This is a timing problem, as discussed at length in [this thread](http://reboot.pro/14130/ \"\").  \nFor now, the only workaround is to avoid booting from an IMG, and to boot from flat files instead. Also [a little driver by Shao](http://reboot.pro/14130/ \"\") is necessary. In other words if you extract all the files from the IMG and put them on your flash disk, it should be working (assuming basic requirements are met, like proper formatting, etc...). I believe Wimb\u0027s IMG_XP_Restore will do that job nicely for you and will also inject Shao\u0027s waitbt32.sys automatically.   \n"
