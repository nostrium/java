I am starting on the SATA since all the data is on the USB HDD and I have just learned a hard lesson on using extended partitions.  \n\nI have zero\u0027d it out using dsfok (thanks wonko) so I have a blank slate here.  \n\nso how can I do this without acronis or other weirdness?   \n\nthanks   \n"

      "content": "WIndows Vista/7 has a DISKPART utility. This allows you to specify an ALIGN parameter which is the number of 512 byte sectors to align the partition start to - e.g. ALIGN\u003d16065 means align the partition at 255\\*63 sectors. Now if you use ALIGN\u003d102400 then this should leave a 50MB (ish) gap - but it would depend on the size of your partitions. So to be sure, you would need to make sure your partitions sizes were just over 50MBxX in size - e.g. 20001MB and not 20000MB. You might need to experiment and I have not tried it so I have no idea if this would work as you want...  \nAlso, for 4K sector drives, make sure that the ALIGN parameter that you use is divisible by 8 or DISKPART may refuse to partition some 4K sector drives.   \n"

      "content": "Wonko, That \\*should\\* work perfect since no 3rd party software is involved. I will try it that way thanks!  \n\nhowever in the past I have had issues with XP disc management when marking a partition as active it then somehow changes from NTFS to FAT16b. I am not sure how this occurs but if I use MBRWiz to mark active it does not happen so I will do that.  \n\nI was reading an old thread here \u003chttp://reboot.pro/9897/\u003e that was marked as a similar topic.  \n\nit explains alot and might be why I lost some data and good reason to avoid using vista in this case but thanks anyway steve6375, Im always thankful for your input too man because you helped me clear a huge hurdle when trying to learn RAM loading through grub4dos. the previous thread has very good info and had a link to [http://partitionlogic.org.uk/](http://partitionlogic.org.uk/ \"External link\") which may be useful in the future too.  \n\nI could use some more input on what might be the best way for me to back-up my main data HDD. what I have is a 500gb SATA internal HDD and Im looking to learn how to make an exact copy of everything on it directly to an identical sized USB HDD. I guess this would be a RAW copy since some of the partitions are encrypted but I dont know and so I ask now.  \n\nI would also like to learn how to copy individual partitions as needed between these two HDD that are identical in size only and if this is possible with encrypted partitions.  \n\nthe set-up Im thinking about is this: four primary partitions.  \n\non the first partition, starting as NTFS with USBoot XPsp2, grub4dos, memdisc, RAM loading XP .ima file, several .iso files that boot from grub4dos, and all system encrypted and as such no longer recognized as NTFS.  \n\nthe second partition starting as NTFS for data storage only and encrypted.  \n\nthe third partition starting as NTFS also for data storage and encrypted.  \n\nthe fourth a small FAT32 for data not encrypted.  \n\nI have a similar set-up that boots almost anywhere but It has only one primary partition and three others in an extended partition but I lost data with this set-up. from reading the other thread it may have been related to that but it has been a while and I cant remember exactly what caused it but I am leary to use an extended partition since then.  \n\nI really just want to have this where I can boot just about anything from the primary like I am doing now and then be able to back-up in full or individual partitions but I dont know how to.  \n\nup until now I have just been moving data between them to back-up (copy/paste) so I am trying to learn a proper back-up plan as well as partitioning scheme.  \n\nif anyone can shed more light on these subjects I could use all I can get here. sorry for the long post/read.  \n\nthanks again.   \n"

I havnt tried it yet but I remember having problems booting it initially because I was adding it after the OS on the same partition. I will test later after I get this back-up set-up back up which is critical at this point but I thought I would throw that out there also in case anyone might have some experience with that also.  \n\nthanks   \n"

      "content": "I have NOTHING actually against encryption itself, I have a lot of things to say against ***UN**needed* encryption. (and more generally about needlessly making one\u0027s life more complex than it actually is ![:ph34r:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/scared9.gif))  \n\nThis is because I do **care** for DATA (I actually like each and every little byte and I often carve them bytes one by one. by hand, bit by bit, out of roots and stones ![:w00t:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/w00t.gif))  \n[http://www.911cd.net...pic\u003d21362\\\u0026st\u003d10](http://www.911cd.net/forums//index.php?showtopic\u003d21362\u0026st\u003d10 \"External link\")  \n\nand I know from experience that - generally speaking - encryption is particularly used (without actual \\*need\\*) by the same peeps that normally DO NOT backup their DATA and before or later lose the data and/or more generally lock themselves out of their \"secure\" whatever.  \n\nThe solutions to the problem:  \n\"Hey, I lost my USB stick with all my precious personal data on it, now everyone that found it can have access to all my bank accounts.\"  \ncan be (among - I am sure - many other ones):\n\n* encrypt your whole device (and implement an effective, tested, verified and re-verified double - or better triple - backup routine for the whole encrypted device AND follow the rouitne ALWAYS, daily or weekly at the most)\n* encrypt just the minimal amount of data you need to protect (and implement an effective, tested, verified and re-verified double - or better triple - backup routine for just te little amount of encrypted data AND follow the routine ALWAYS, every time something changes in these data)\n* DO NOT store \\*anything\\* you may regret losing on the USB stick\n* DO NOT lose your USB stick (pay some attention, HECK it contains UNencrypted important data!)\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nSame approach can be used for a portable (laptop/notebook/smartphone, etc.).  \n\nFor a desktop, as said elsewhere:  \n\u003chttp://reboot.pro/12367/\u003e  \ncleaning lady hacks are not that common, and some mechanical means to prevent physical access to the PC is usally much more effective.  \n\nAnyway, since you are going anyway to encrypt whole partitions, you will need dd-like or \"forensic sound\" partition imaging (or whole disk imaging).  \n\nAs a comparison (still about the convenience of it) on a normal system (not encrypted) a dd-like image of a 500 Gb hard disk should take around (talking of \"normal\" hardware) with something around 60 Gb/hour (through USB 2.0) around 9:30 hours to image your hard disk, or with something like 240 Gb/hour (direct Sata to Sata or e-sata) around 2:15.  \nThis you should do daily (or maybe weekly), TWICE (first and second backup copy), and of course burst writing/reading continuously for such extents of time can shorten a bit lifetime of the disks involved.  \nA first run backup of a 500 Gb (let\u0027s assume with 2/3 used) may take some (USB 2.0) 8 hours or (direct sata) 2 hours.  \nEach incremental backup session (unless of course you daily delete all contents and replace them with different ones) is normally a question of minutes.  \n\nAbout apps to use, there is a rather complete \"catalog\" here:  \n[http://www.911cd.net...showtopic\u003d16534](http://www.911cd.net/forums//index.php?showtopic\u003d16534 \"External link\")  \n[http://www.msfn.org/...howtopic\u003d100299](http://www.msfn.org/board/index.php?showtopic\u003d100299 \"External link\")  \nremember that if you are going into the \"encrypted partition\" or \"encrypted disk\" route you will need to chose amone ONLY those capable of dd-like or \"sector-by-sector\" image.  \n\n![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif)  \nWonko   \n"
