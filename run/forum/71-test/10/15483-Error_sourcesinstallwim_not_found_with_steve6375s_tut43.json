      "content": "Hello everyone..  \n\nI tried steve6375\u0027s tut#43 to make a usb pen drive with ISOs of both Windows 7 x64 SP1 and Windows 8 Develop Preview (maybe more in the future) because I often install different operating systems on different computers (and for this, I bought a 32GB pen drive). I followed the tips in tut#43 and successfully got my usb pen drive booting with grub4dos, and booting into Windows 8 Installation.  \n\nHowever, after LOADISO succeeded loading the ISO file again, it can\u0027t find sources/install.wim and prompted me with \"do you want to repair\" or something...  \n\nAnd in the Windows 8 ISO, sources/install.wim is there...  \n\nSo I can\u0027t install Windows 8 for now... because my computer doesn\u0027t have a DVD drive.  \n\nCould steve, or anyone else, help me with this?   \n"

I\u0027m at work now and I will try it when I get back home... I think it\u0027s a Removable drive. I will check it when at home too.  \n\nBTW, the Windows 8 DP ISO I am using is as large as 4.8GB (because it includes Visual Studio For Metro). Does your method have memory limitation (like: something will went wrong if I try to use this ISO to install Win8 on a machine with 4GB or 2GB memory).  \nMy desktop computer has 8GB memory, but my laptop only has 2GB... And I want to use one pen drive to install OS to these computers...  \n\nBTW 2, what does the last tag in AutoUnattend.xml mean? I see some Vista \\\u0026 wim words...   \n\n**Edited by coolcfan, 21 September 2011 - 07:29 AM.**\n"

As you said, the Windows 7 installation seemed to work (I procceeded to EULA and then exited, but it should work). However, when I tried Windows 8, it didn\u0027t work. I can\u0027t find any drive containing sources/install.wim..  \n\nSo what should I add to the cmd to see more information? What should I echo?  \n\nAnd is it a problem caused by Win8 ISO\u0027s 4.8GB volume, while the Win7 ISO is of less than 3GB? I can ensure that the directory structure in the two ISOs are almost the same, especially for the sources/install.wim...   \n"
