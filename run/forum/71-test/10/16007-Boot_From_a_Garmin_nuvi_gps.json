Possibly, if the computer detects it as a boot device.  \n\nIf you\u0027re asking if you can use the software on your Garmin on your computer. Not directly. You would first need an emulator.  \n\nI know it can be done for WinCE devices. But Garmin uses it\u0027s own OS based on Linux. No idea if any emulator can handle it.  \n\n![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif)   \n"
