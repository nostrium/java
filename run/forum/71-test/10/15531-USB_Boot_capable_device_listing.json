      "content": "Hi guys / gals,  \n\nThis is my first post to reboot.pro despite having been a reader for a fairly long while.  \nI\u0027m currently trying to go about setting up a Windows 7 USB bootable HD for transfer between my home and office PC\u0027s.  \n\nI\u0027m not new to booting via USB and have XP on a Maxtor 500GB USB HD, which my other half uses on her work laptop.  \n\nI\u0027ve spent the last two days trying to make an Iomega Prestige USB2.0/3.0 500GB HD (gifted to me) into a bootable drive and failed.... HARD.  \nI\u0027ve removed the Iomega crapware Virtual CD and lowlevel formatted it using several tools.  \nUsing bootsect /nt60 F: /mbr - results in bootsect becoming non responsive.  \nGrub4Dos / RMPrepUSB / Zero\u0027ing out the MBR all return a variety of errors or \"parameter is incorrect\" messages.  \n\nI\u0027ve concluded that maybe this is due to some hidden partition or protection of the MBR due to the supposed hardware AES encryption.  \n\nIs there a list anywhere of USB HD\u0027s that are confirmed working as bootable USB devices (I\u0027m aware of the caveats around \"bootable\" based on BIOS limitations etc)?  \n\nAs I\u0027ve got no where with this device I\u0027ve persuaded the shop it was bought from to give me an exchange and I\u0027m currently looking at:  \n\nSEAGATE STAA500200 Go Flex Ultra Portable External Hard Drive - 500GB  \n\nAnyone got any experience with this device?  \n\nThanks,  \n\nAlex   \n"

      "content": "hi Alex,   \n\nwelcome to reboot!  \n\nI have two older seagate USB free agent GO HDD and they both boot fine but any USB HDD should not have a problem. it is the USB Flash drives (thumbdrives) that can be problematic.  \n\ncheck out this link and try the pretest to see if it will boot:  \n\n[http://www.usboot.or...nts and Pretest](http://www.usboot.org/tiki-index.php?page\u003dPrearrangements%20and%20Pretest \"External link\")  \n\nalso try it another machine to confirm your results if possible.  \n\nBTW, I have had nothing but success with using dsfok to zero out HDDs when needed to start over from scratch. I learned about it here but the board wont let me look up my older posts but it is a commandline program and allways works for me.   \n"

      "content": "Zoso: I to thought that it should be possible to make any USB HD bootable, as already mentioned I\u0027ve done it with XP on a 500GB Maxtor drive and had already accomplished Win7 on a Sandisk Cruzer 8GB thumbdrive as a test.  \n\nAs per Wonko\u0027s suggestion in another thread I tried the tool DSFOK mentioned here: \u003chttp://reboot.pro/4015/page__st__21\u003e to try and delete any manufacturer specific bootcode or hidden partitions. The tool seemed unable to write to the disk in those early sectors, can\u0027t remember the exact error code now.  \nEvery tool I tried seemed able to write the bootsector but not the bootcode in the MBR.  \n\nI am assuming that this was due to something relating to the AES Hardware Encryption feature - other than that I draw a blank.  \n\nUn/fortunately, I took the simple option and exchanged the Iomega unit for the Seagate unit mentioned above, which worked flawlessly first time!  \n\nThanks to both of you for your answers, much appreciated!  \n\nRegards,  \n\nAlex   \n"
