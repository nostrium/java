      "content": "Hi :smile:  \n\nI got this ZBox attached behind TV, it only has ONE USB2 port which is used for wireless keyboard+mouse and rest all are USB3 ports (which does not boot any USB2/1 sticks)  \n\nI got grub4dos IN + Windows and all but I can\u0027t [install](http://www.openelec.tv/get-openelec \"External link\") [OpenELEC](http://xbmc.org/natethomas/2011/10/26/openelec-1-0-released/ \"External link\") because it [requires USB](http://www.openelec.tv/installation/install-1-windows \"External link\") sticks! (to make things worse, there is no DVD/CD etc reader or writer)  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nThere are [optimized builds for specific](http://www.openelec.tv/get-openelec \"External link\") platforms (mine is ION), so.... here is what i DID:  \n\n01. Modified batch file so it installs on X: (which is D:xbmc.img FiraDisk memdisk)  \n02. booted off from that xbmc.img (some syslinux started but never reached to [Installer part](http://www.openelec.tv/installation/install-2 \"External link\"))  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nSomething tells me, this place can really solve this problem... ![:clap:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/clap.gif)  \nEDIT:  \n![Posted Image](http://www.openelec.tv/images/stories/howto/createstick7.png)  \nI have these files.... I think there is a way grub4dos can start the installer? and after installing possibly even boot IMG?   \n"
