      "content": "Hi,  \nHow can I have all of these bootable tools on a single Bootable USB:  \nI have their bootable ISOs but I couldn\u0027t find a tool than support all of them. I have tried **Yumi** , **XBoot** , **SARDU** .  \n- ERD Commander 5 (XP)  \n- ERD Commander 6.5 x86/x64 (7)  \n- Kaspersky Rescue 10  \n- Hiren\u0027s boot CD 14 (all tools, (Dos tools+XP Live)  \n- Windows 7 Installer  \n\nPlease note that I need all of them. Some one told me that the ERD is a commercial tools so they won\u0027t support in their software! But assume that I have bought ERD commanders.   \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nI\u0027m not expert in writing scripts and boot codes and I prefer to use a tools with GUI or follow a simple instruction.  \n\nYumi was not too bad but it doesn\u0027t support hiren\u0027s 14 xp live. Sardu had many problems. xboot didn\u0027t have many tools. ![:dubbio:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/dubbio.gif) ![:cold:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cold.gif)   \n"
