      "content": "I just reformatted a 2 terabyte USB drive to FAT32 for some educational experimentation. While formatted as NTSF I was typically getting about a 20 MB/second transfer rate from the 64 bit win 7 drive. Once formatted as FAT32 this dropped to 400 to 700 KB/second. A mere 5 Gig transfer is taking roughly as long as a 400 Gig transfer did before the reformat. Internet downloads are faster than that. Not only that but it is noticeably dragging the system down which it never did before. AMD Athlon II X2 250u processors at 1.6 GHz each with 4 GB of ram installed, nothing to brag about but not so bad it should be an issue under the load. No I really do not care if WIN 7 bombs and never comes back on the 600 GB primary drive and never even bothered making a restore disk.  \n\nOuch, it just bombed out on copying a 4.3 GB file. Should have remembered that one. Back to Gparted for some disk splitting. GRUB is at least working now.  \n\nAnyway, is this loss of transfer speed to a FAT32 USB drive normal? It is using USB 2.0, but I will get me a firewire adapter if that is what it takes.   \n\nI would also ask if I can boot a Linux distro stored on an NTSF partition, but I\u0027ll figure that out myself soon enough. I assume it can\u0027t be a problem if loaded on a ramdrive but some of the things I need to do requires saving updates. I\u0027m doing everything by hand, without installers, for educational purposes. Too many gaps in my knowledge at low levels, which can only be fixed by breaking things.  \n\nThanks   \n"
