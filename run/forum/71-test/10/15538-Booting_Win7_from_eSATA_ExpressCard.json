      "content": "Hi! I\u0027m new to this forum. I\u0027m glad to have found this very good place.  \n\nI need to boot an external hard drive. I would like to ask for some guide to point me to the right track. Thanks!  \n\nI have a Lenovo Thinkpad X220 laptop. I replace the hard drive with SSD. And installed Linux with syslinux bootloader onto the SSD. I don\u0027t want to waste the hard drive came with the laptop. I bought an eSATA ExpressCard and a hard drive dock with eSATA for it. How can I make use of grub4dos or other method to boot the original hard drive with pre-installed Windows 7? Thank you very much!   \n"

The closest hack would be starting the boot process using the primary boot drive then having it switch over to the expresscard e-sata HDD part way through. There\u0027s a \"Kansas City Shuffle\" method on here on how to do that.  \n\nAnother way you could consider doing it would be by either tapping the mSATA SSD slot or the docking connector to make a e-sata like port out of them. Those SATA ports have bios boot support.   \n"
