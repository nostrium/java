I try everything i know, and i could find on google.  \nI found this forum today and as i read more i know less what i want. So...  \n\ni have win7 on my lap top, i wanna install some win (whatever u suggest) on usb so i can disconnect my hdd and use system from usb.   \n\nQuestion:  \nis it better to install win7 or xp? To use fool or lite or smallest installation (i found something like that as question in some thread, i didnt even know till know that this exist)?  \nhow to do all that?   \n"

I guess it relates to the issue of one computer or many...and as MedEvil also pointed out the uses. Remember that full windows (for full use) is tied to the hardware and activation.

Every instance (extremely rare) of an ISO being infected that I\u0027ve read about (including ones cited by RoyM) have occurred at ISO *creation* from an infected machine.\nAn iso is a file - virii can infect / destoy files - ergo virii can infect / destroy iso on rw medium.  \n\n\u003e seems to fall into the category of the theoretical.\nEverything is theoretical till it happens the first time. Would it comfort you, to know, that you\u0027re the first one, if your bank account gets drained or would you be furous, that nobody did anything, though the risk was known?  \n\n\u003e If there is an instance of an ISO being infected *while booting from itself* from an infected *offline system,*please give details so we can know how to protect ourselves.\nEver heared about BIOS virii? Ok, they are pretty seldom these days, but they are doable and existed at one time.  \nBesides that, executing a single infected file from the infected system is enough, to let the virii run wild on all writable media.  \nOr how about simply mounting a partition, i\u0027m sure that could be used to kick of a virus.  \n\nYou\u0027re playing on the fact, that noone has yet created a virus, that targets specificly computer technicians. But just because it doesn\u0027t exist today, doesn\u0027t mean it won\u0027t tomorrow.  \n\n\u003e How?

This would present a serious security threat that would need to be addressed. Your proof of concept involved a tool (eicfg removal tool) which \"works by toggling the deletion bit in the UDF file table, eliminating the need for unpacking and rebuilding the ISO\". Since it is equally possible to do this with CD-R media, it seems your point was moot.  \n\nIt is still my assertion that booting from an ISO is safe (even on writable drive) since attempting to mount, re-write and save the (now infected) ISO would result in crashing the OS your running from. Even if the image completely resides in RAM, you would still be attempting to re-write the image your working from and why bother? If it\u0027s possible to write a virus to RAM, then you don\u0027t need an ISO image to infect, just write the virus in RAM to infect the system on reboot, something I always believed to be impossible since RAM is cleared on reboot. Writing to the BIOS chip would be more likely but is outside the discussion here since it has nothing to do with ISOs vs CD-Rs.  \n\nI can (just barely) imagine a scenario where, while your working from an image in RAM, the virus secretly mounts and rewrites the inactive ISO residing on writable UFD/HDD; this might bypass the usual checks against writing to the drive directly but then this could only affect the system on a subsequent boot of the (now infected) ISO. I seriously doubt any lowlife virus writer could possess this degree of delayed gratification but even so, a quick hash check should root out this possibility before next boot (something I might actually implement).  \n\nI think the real discussion should be writable media vs read-only (the ISO is neither here nor there) and *there* , I agree, better to use RO media like a UFD with RO switch or at least scan it after every use, good idea anyway.   \n"

Yes that would prevent a scenario like: making an image in RAM - modifying it - burning it back to CDVD. But this is impossible for CDVD-R anyway.  \n\nAn ISO image on the other hand would not be protected by beeing used, since it would not need to be unmounted to be changed. The virus could change any file as long as the new file does not require more storage space than the original.  \nA simple binary patcher can do that, if you like to test yourself.  \n\nThe theoretical possibility, that also a CDVD-R could get infected by a virus, would be highly tricky.  \nCause the virus would had to work with the limitation in which data on a CDVD-R can be changed.   \nThere can only pits be added, but not removed!  \nThis limitation would require the virus to target one specific file, which has a usable byte structure.  \n\nDamaging the CDVD-R by adding senseless pits, should be no problem.  \n\n![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif)   \n"

Why do you play dumb now?  \n\nIf i can\u0027t write a single bit. I write a whole sector, which is empty except for 1 bit.  \nOr did you mean, that given the way data is written to the CD, i can\u0027t change 1 bit, but have to change at least 2?  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n\u003e This fixed pattern are written once.  \n\u003e This reduce much user storage space.\nBut those markers can\u0027t possibly each take up a whole sector.

So if it works there, it should be possible on a CD-R as well, just that the two writes would overlay to form a new data pattern, instead of the new one replacing the old one.  \n\n![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif)   \n"

      "content": "Ok, now i finally get you.  \nYou mean, that i can\u0027t say, write bit X. Cause it will be encoded and all changed up. Did i understand you right?  \n\nLike i said before, to alter data to something useful, one needs to have original data as well as overwrite data, with which this is even possible, given the technical limitations (8-14 encoding as well as how data is stored on the CD itself)  \n\n\u003e How accurate is a end user hardware?  \n\u003e It\u0027s technical possible to assign exactly a written space matching at bit level?  \n\u003e To overwrite at bit level, you have to position at bit level first.  \n\u003e I doubt it\u0027s technically possible to position at bit accuracy, given a end user drive.\nThis a good question!  \nCounter question, is bit precise writing required to add a new session to a multisession CD?   \n\nOn the other hand, i remember, when a buffer underrun was the dead of a CD-R.   \n\n\u003e Did you ever user packet writing CD-R? How did colour change at underside?  \n\u003e Was it filled from inside to out?  \n\u003e Are data added at end of previous written space?\nYes i did. Something like 15 years ago. The driver constantly crashed the system, even when not writing to a CD. There were also some other complications, i can\u0027t remeber now.   \nLong story short, i abandoned UDF. And can\u0027t really remember enough, to answer your other qestions.  \n\n\u003e A CD-R uses a organic layer.

On a CD-R, can\u0027t data be deleted, but maybe modified, by writing over the existing data. In which case only lands can be turned into pits but not pits into lands.  \n\nSo only new pits can be created and existing ones elongated. IF precise enough writing is possible!  \n\n![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif)   \n"
