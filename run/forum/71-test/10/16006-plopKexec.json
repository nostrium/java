It fits on a 1.44MB floppy. Its also possible to start plopKexec from CD or any Linux loader/boot manager.  \n\nIts based on a linux kernel and can load only other linux kernels! PlopKexec is not a fork of kexec-loader.  \n\nThe current plopKexec version is 0.2. The Linux Distro detection works currently only with distros that are using Syslinux. When some config files are making problems, then it should be no problem to fix plopKexec. When people like plopKexec and they need support for grub and lilo config files, then its possible to add it. This program has a big potential for many features. The distros can be on FAT, EXT2/3 formatted USB drives and on USB CD/DVD\u0027s. You can easily boot the detected Linux Distro from a menu.  \n\nCompiled for i386, Linux Kernel 3.1.4  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nUSB Host support:  \nUSB 1.1: UHCI, OHCI  \nUSB 2.0: EHCI  \nUSB 3.0: xHCI (linux experimantal)  \n\nMore infos, configuration examples and the source code are coming soon when I have more time.  \n\n[http://www.plop.at/en/plopkexec.html](http://www.plop.at/en/plopkexec.html \"External link\")  \n\nbest regards  \nelmar   \n"
