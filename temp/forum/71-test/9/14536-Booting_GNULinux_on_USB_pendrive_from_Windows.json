      "content": "Hi all,  \n\nI\u0027m new here and I hope that my question hasn\u0027t been asked before as, I am probably stupid, but I haven\u0027t found any \"search\" button to explore previous posts. :wink:  \n\nAim : to be able to boot a usb live system from any computer I sit in front of, even when it isn\u0027t \"friendly\" ; let\u0027s say usb boot non active in a bios which is password protected.  \n\nI wonder if this could be achieved with this setup ?  \n\n* a usb pendrive with 2 partitions.\n* a small FAT32 (or FAT16 or FAT) at the beginning to make it accessible from a Windows OS.\n* another partition with a GNU/Linux-live OS, marked as bootable.\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nSo that :  \n\n* if the computer offers usb boot, I can boot directly onto my second partition.\n* if is doesn\u0027t, I let the host Windows OS boot, access the first partition and use stuff there to launch the OS on the second partition **without rebooting the hardware**.\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nI have two questions :  \n\n* Can a computer boot on the second partition (marked as bootable) of a usb pendrive ?\n* Booting a GNU/Linux OS from within a started Windows OS has been doable in the past : one had to use LoadLin with a Win95/98/Me. But Win 2000/XP/+ are differents (see the link below) so I don\u0027t know if it still can be done ?\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nOf course, I have spent quite some time looking for information about this. For example, I found this page about [LoadLin/Grub4Dos](http://marc.herbert.free.fr/linux/win2linstall.html \"External link\"), but it was last updated in 2006 so I\u0027d like more recent information and/or users feedback on this kind of setup.  \n\nThanks for any help ![:coffee:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/coffee.gif)   \n"

Sorry, I hadn\u0027t mentioned this, but that\u0027s the reason why I\u0027m looking for a \"launching without hardware booting\" solution. I was hoping that LoadLin now had an equivalent for Win2k+ OS :wink: It looks like there is none.  \n\nCan you confirm that there is no hope of a solution without a hard-reboot because of protected-mode vs real-mode ?  \n\nThanks.   \n"
