      "content": "I\u0027m curious about how to install BURG to a flash drive. An executable utility exists for installing it to a system drive on Windows, but I\u0027m reluctant to try it on my main computer, and I have no other boxes to spare. There does appear to be a compilation system for BURG (makes sense since it appears to be open source) but I don\u0027t think this is the answer either.  \nHas anyone managed to make a BURG install for flash drives? I have a bootable BURG command line flash drive, but the menu system etc seem to be beyond me at the moment. If you made it work, how?  \n\nEDIT: I have asked on the burgloader forums here earlier: [http://www.burgloade...php?topic\u003d206.0](http://www.burgloader.com/bbs/index.php?topic\u003d206.0 \"External link\")  \nHowever I haven\u0027t gotten any answers as of yet.   \n\n**Edited by tummychow, 07 February 2011 - 12:05 AM.**\n"

As soon as a poster gets friendly to you, you become aggressive. You never admit to have gaps in your knowledge or posts, despite any human being\u0027s knowledge is extremely limited. You never say \"Thanks\", \"I learned something new\", \"I appreciate your suggestion\", and something along these lines to ANYONE. Yet as soon as a poster responds to you in your own style, you become depressed and melancholic, loose sharpness of mind. So, how people can amend or correct your posts without traumatizing you beyond believe? Pls suggest... ![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif)   \n\n\u003e You are very welcome to, especially if you will provide some actual proof of the \"incorrect\"...

Do you intend to say \"Grasias\" to ANYONE to show signs of adapting to others in a seemingly non-familiar territory? Such behavior is a sure indicator of extreme discomfort with your own being. Are you comfortable with yourself my dear? In any case, why select irrelevant forum medium to look for \"enemies\"? People just want to share knowledge and ideas here. Why others should suffer from your rude attitude aimed at improving lost self-esteem? May be you need to be quarantined until hopefully restore sense of reality? ![:whistling:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/happy22.gif)   \n\nWould it be more rational (and polite, thus contributing to your Sig goal) to address the OP directly with some constructive brief comments complemented by your lovely links instead of attacking other posters? ![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif)   \n"

      "content": "I\u0027m not for all the arguing business, but in any case, I\u0027m mostly curious as to how to do it. Particularly for the loopback feature (which, as I understand, is available in GRUB2 for accessing menu options built into any grub2 compatible image). I\u0027ve gotten stuff to work in Grub4DOS so far (although I cleared it all off to try out BURG on my experimentation drive; as noted in another thread, I bricked a precious 16gb drive and I\u0027m more careful with it now).  \n\nAnyway, I\u0027m wondering about the bucfg archive provided in the precompiled BURG ([http://www.burgloade...php?topic\u003d101.0](http://www.burgloader.com/bbs/index.php?topic\u003d101.0 \"External link\") the top part is all chinese, but the bottom part is english, and attached are some precompiled BURG bits). I\u0027ve managed to install a working BURG command line to flash drive, but not an actual BURG boot menu etc. Part of the installation seems to be unpacking an fbinst archive, bucfg, to the hidden partition. What I want to do is... unpack it to the main partition, so I can examine its contents (perhaps the cfg files to configure burg are hiding in there?). Is this even possible? I\u0027m kinda hoping that this is the answer to my problem, but since I don\u0027t have any specifics, I do have my doubts.   \n\n**Edited by tummychow, 08 February 2011 - 12:40 AM.**\n"
