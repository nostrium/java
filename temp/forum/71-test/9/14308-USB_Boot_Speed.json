The stick itself tested with 24MB continuous read speed.   \nAlso used some other sticks with lower(17MB/s) or higher(31,7MB/s) read speeds. The loading time for the image stayed absolutely identical.  \n\nHas anyone else come across this phenomenon or can attest to a higher USB-Boot-Speed?  \n\nbtw. It was an XP based PE image.  \n\n![:smiling9:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/smiling9.gif)   \n"

      "content": "The image get\u0027s loaded by BIOS routines, only after the image is loaded into ram, the kernel takes over and one can use drivers.  \n\nThe curious thing is the value 12,5MB/s. I don\u0027t recognize it as any known limit.   \nAlso assuming that PIO mode is used, to load the image, the actual speed of PIO mode depends highly on the CPU. Which should cause a way broader spectrum on speeds.  \n\n![:thumbsup:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/thumbsup.gif)   \n"
