      "content": "\u003e Sun 19/Sep/2010  \n\u003e\n\u003e Plop Boot Manager 5.0.11-rc1 + updated tools released.  \n\u003e\n\u003e Boot Manager updates:  \n\u003e CPU usage heavily reduced.  \n\u003e Graphic card init bug fixed.  \n\u003e himem.sys bug fixed - himem.sys was unable to enable gate A20 on some machines after the boot manager was running.  \n\u003e Update of the number of hard disk drives in the bios data area for booting usb reactivated.  \n\u003e Loading the network option rom from the main menu (+ new hotkey) to continue to boot from network.  \n\u003e Linux Kernel Command Line support for plpbt.bin - dynamic configuration with parameters.  \n\u003e FAT12/16 boot sector update - important to boot dos from 2nd, 3rd,... hard disk.  \n\u003e PCMCIA CardBus support for USB PC-Cards.  \n\u003e USB drivers updated.  \n\u003e Partition setup text \u0027VIEW/EDIT/COPY data\u0027 changed to \u0027Edit MBR/Import data\u0027.  \n\u003e ISO files in floppy emulation mode are removed from the zip file.  \n\u003e plpcfgbt updates:  \n\u003e Help page layout changed.  \n\u003e Now, the program reports a warning when plpbt.bin has an old config structure - before plpcfgbt 0.9 the program reported an error because of the config structure and stopped the plpbt.bin configuration.  \n\u003e New parameters are hiddenusb, hiddencdrom, skippcmcia, fastpcmcia.  \n\u003e\n\u003e plpgenbtldr updates:  \n\u003e xo output removed.  \n\u003e plpbtldr.bin writes an error info text when there was problem with loading plpbt.bin.  \n\u003e\n\u003e plpchk.exe:  \n\u003e plpchk.exe is a new dos tool to detect plop usb driver from config.sys, from a batch file or from the command line. The program can create/remove a file that can be checked for existence and it returns the errorlevel code for batch files. You can run it in a hidden mode without any screen output.  \n\u003e\n\u003e The boot manager page will be updated when 5.0.11 is released. The updated readme.txt is already in the rc1 zip file.\n[http://www.plop.at/e...mngrusblog.html](http://www.plop.at/en/bootmngrusblog.html \"External link\")   \n"

      "content": "\u003e Wed 12/Jan/2011  \n\u003e\n\u003e Plop Boot Manager 5.0.11-2 released  \n\u003e\n\u003e Bugfix: USB Driver memory allocation bug fixed. The driver didn\u0027t detect usb drives on some machines although 5.0.10 detected the drives.  \n\u003e\n\u003e Plop Boot Manager 5.0.12-test1 released  \n\u003e\n\u003e New main menu hotkey ALT-u. You can skip usb devices before the boot manager identifies the device. The usb driver must be small and has no full error handling implemented. Sometimes, the boot manager hangs during the usb device identification because of the missing error handling. Mostly its because of internal bluetooth adapters. With ALT-u you are able to skip those devices. When you don\u0027t always want to press ALT-u to skip the devices manually, then you can set the number of devices to skip in the boot manager setup. The setup option to skip mass storage devices has been replaced with the new feature.  \n\u003e\n\u003e The keys for skipping devices when you use CTRL-u or ALT-u are now  \n\u003e s ... skip device (in 5.0.11 it was \"n\" for next device)  \n\u003e enter ... identify/boot device (in 5.0.11 it was any key press)  \n\u003e\n\u003e Booting from 2nd, 3rd or 4th hard disk activates now an int13 driver that swaps the hard disk drive number. Why wasn\u0027t that implemented earlier? I was meaning that its part of the operating system to handle the correct drive number when its booting from a hard disk number \\\u003e80h. I changed my thinking because of a good argument of sambul61 at \u003chttp://reboot.pro.\u003e The edit of the boot flag hard disk number in the \"linked partitions\" setup became useless and has been removed.\n\n@neo_leopard  \nYou can boot Plop from tftp with PXELINUX, grub4dos, grub, grub2, ...  \n[http://www.plop.at/e....html#noinstall](http://www.plop.at/en/bootmanager.html#noinstall \"External link\")  \n\nYou can also flash Plop to the rom of your network card (you will loose booting from network):  \n[http://www.plop.at/e...ger.html#plprom](http://www.plop.at/en/bootmanager.html#plprom \"External link\")   \n"
