      "content": "Hi!  \n\nintroduction:  \nI have now a 80 GB USB HDD in a USB HDD enclosure. The harddisk was preformated with some ugly guid partition table but I think I got finally ride of it. I am not sure, the is label as 80 GB but Acronis and all tools show only 74 GB. (I don\u0027t care about this 6 GB much but I hope this freaking guid partition table is getting lost.)  \n\nFirst I want to make the USB HDD bootable for FreeDOS (and later with grub4dos). But I ran into several problems.  \n\n1:  \nWith virtual floppy I mounted a bootable FreeDOS image as A:\\\\. Then with the HP Drive Key I wanted to make the device bootable for a first test. The first thing \"The user-supplied DOS system files are not compatible with FAT32.\". First question, where to get/make a FAT32 compatible bootable floppy image?  \n\n2:  \nThen I wanted to format the device for test without bootable disk option. FAT does not work because of \\\u003e2 GB, so I choose FAT32. Next strange error \"Failed to format the device.\"  \n\nIs the HP Drive Key for USB pendrives only and not for bigger USB HDD\u0027s? What tool I could use to make this USB HDD bootable?  \n\n3:  \nMy third try. I plugged to USB HDD into VMware with Ubuntu 8.04. (done that before successfully with USB pendrives) Unmounted the device, started geparted, deleted all partitions, created one big FAT32 partition and set boot flag.   \n\n./bootlace.com /dev/sdb  \nError: Invalid partition table. Must specify --floppy explicitly for floppy.  \n\nconclusion:  \nIt\u0027s all pretty strange. With normal USB pendrives this was a lot more easy. I have the feeling that this guid partition table can not be completely removed. Or tools like HP Drive Keys can not handle all big USB HDD\u0027s (doubt that).  \n\nI hope you have some wise idea... Otherwise I try to use money back guarantee and buy some other disk.   \n"

      "content": "You do not need anything of what you did.  \n\nThe HP USB format utility is NOT needed, and however is not \"designed\" to work with FreeDOS on FAT32, and if you use it, you will have just a big 80 Gb partition, that of course will be FAT32.  \n\nMoreover, as you call it \"HP Drive Key\", it is designed for USB sticks, rather than hard disks, it may have some limits on big hard disks.  \n\nExternal hard disks are generally seen as \"fixed\", thus they can be partitioned \"normally\" with disk management.  \n\nOnce you have the disk partitioned as you wish, the usual recommendation is of having at least one partition FAT16, size smaller than 1 Gb, for compatibility with DOS 6.22, or, if you do not need it, a smallish FAT32 partition will do for FreeDOS or DOS 7.x/8.0.  \n\nAll other partitions are better if NTFS, or, if you use Linux, ext2/3 or ReiserFS.  \n\nOnce you have created the first partition, use the normal FORMAT command, choosing, as above to format it either FAT16 or FAT32.  \n\nThen copy to it:  \nNTLDR  \nNTDETECT.COM  \nBOOT.INI, edited to contain an entry like this:  \n\u003e C:\\\\grldr\u003d\"grub4dos\"\ngrldr (from grub4dos package)  \na menu.lst file containing these entries:  \n\n```\ntitle FreeDOS\n\nfind --set-root /kernel.sys\n\nchainloader /kernel.sys\n```\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nadd the FreeDOS system files:  \nKERNEL.SYS  \nCOMMAND.COM  \nand the FreeDOS SYS.COM utility.  \n\nTry booting from the USB, you should get to BOOT.INI choices, choose grub4dos entry, you should get tomenu.lst choices, choose FreeDOS.  \n\nYou should be able to boot to FreeDOS.  \n\nIf you really want to install the FreeDOS bootsector, run:  \n\n```\nSYS C\u0026#58; C\u0026#58;\n```\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nThere may be some \"leftovers\" of your previously attempts in the MBR or bootsector, if this is the case, simply write 00\u0027s to, say, the first 100 sectors, using either a Disk/hex editor or a \"dd-like\" program as dsfo/dsfi, part of the DSFOK package:  \n[http://www.boot-land...opic\u003d4015\\\u0026st\u003d21](http://www.boot-land.net/forums/?showtopic\u003d4015\u0026st\u003d21 \"External link\")  \nbefore attempting again.  \n\njaclaz   \n"

I even used was_jaclaz\u0027s advice about copying ntldr, ntdetect.com and boot.ini files to first partition and installing  \nGrub4dos but nothing makes my HDD bootable it just goes into Windows after choosing to boot from USB at startup.  \n\nI\u0027m trying this on two HP desktop PCs (HP Compaq 8000 and HP Compaq DC7700) where my USB stick boot without any problem but this USB HDD doesn\u0027t.  \nIs it the BIOS problem? It shouldn\u0027t be because USB sticks don\u0027t have any problem booting.  \nYesterday I was able to boot from USB HDD on my notebook at home (I think I used RMPrepUSB to install Grub4dos on HDD and that was all I need it, I even  \ndidn\u0027t made 1st partition active then). I\u0027m realy confused now... is there any app that can automaticaly prepare my HDD (like RMPrepUSB do for USB sticks)  \nbecause I\u0027m, to stupid to do it manualy ![:clap:](https://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/clap.gif)   \n\n**Edited by tonyzg, 21 March 2011 - 09:53 AM.**\n"

Do I need to install Grub4dos (and copy grldr) on HDD or not? My guess is not.  \nAnother... Do I need to have Grub4dos installed on my PC here at work (cause it\u0027s not installed here)? My guess is not, too.  \nI formated partition as FAT32(sized around 4GB) made it active and the rest of disk was lesft unallocated.  \nWill it make any difference if I try to format it as NTFS?  \nCould it be some problem with my MBR or bootsector?  \nOne more thing. The WD Passport have one hidden partition which in Windows shows up as virtual CD.  \nMaybe that partition is causing problem...  \n\nNew Edit: hmmmmmm I think it\u0027s the problem that BIOS and this HDD don\u0027t like each other.  \nJust went to BIOS and saw that it recognize this HDD as 0.00MB WD SES Device.  \nI pluged in another external I have (Seagate) and it\u0027s recognized as 500GB Seagate.  \nI\u0027ll try to do everything again with this Seagate HDD and report back about results.   \n\n**Edited by tonyzg, 21 March 2011 - 11:31 AM.**\n"

What I do is:  \n\n* Prepare a very small (like 30 MB) FAT16 partition on the USB HDD with Windows.\n* Copy GRLDR to it.\n* Copy a DOS floppy image to it. The DOS floppy contains **FDISK** , **FORMAT** , **SYS** as well as GRUB4DOS.\n* Save the MBR partition table.\n* **DD** the GRUB4DOS MBR to the USB HDD.\n* Restore the MBR partition table.\n* Boot a computer to the USB HDD. It boots GRUB4DOS.\n* Map the DOS floppy image as a RAM disk.\n* Erase the USB HDD MBR with GRUB4DOS.\n* Boot the DOS RAM disk. It obviously boots DOS.\n* Use FDISK to create a nice, FAT32 partition of whatever size I desire. I choose to make it the active partition.\n* FDISK tells me to reboot, but I launch GRUB4DOS, instead.\n* I then boot the DOS RAM disk again.

FAT does not work because of \\\u003e2 GB, so I choose FAT32. Next strange error \"Failed to format the device.\"  \n\nIs the HP Drive Key for USB pendrives only and not for bigger USB HDD\u0027s? What tool I could use to make this USB HDD bootable?  \n\n3:  \nMy third try. I plugged to USB HDD into VMware with Ubuntu 8.04. (done that before successfully with USB pendrives) Unmounted the device, started geparted, deleted all partitions, created one big FAT32 partition and set boot flag.   \n\n./bootlace.com /dev/sdb  \nError: Invalid partition table. Must specify --floppy explicitly for floppy.  \n\nconclusion:  \nIt\u0027s all pretty strange. With normal USB pendrives this was a lot more easy. I have the feeling that this guid partition table can not be completely removed. Or tools like HP Drive Keys can not handle all big USB HDD\u0027s (doubt that).  \n\nI hope you have some wise idea... Otherwise I try to use money back guarantee and buy some other disk.   \n"

Today at work (diferent PC) it didn\u0027t boot so I reused RMPrepUSB (as at home) and no luck.  \n\n\u003e RMPREPUSB was born because of a limitation of the Windows built in tools when it comes to USB sticks (not because they are \"sticks\" but because they are usually set to be a \"removable\" device).  \n\nI\u0027m using RMPrepUSB only for installing Grub4dos since I was playing with USB sticks lately and had everything in one place with that app.  \nI know I can use grubinst_gui.exe but I just grow into RMPrepUSB so I use it instead ![:clap:](https://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/clap.gif)   \nI only once tried to use option \"Prepare Disk\" on my USB HDD since I read somewhere that it can be done like that.   \n\n\u003e Wipe BOTH the hard disk and your ideas ![:rofl:](https://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/roll1.gif) about how to make it bootable and simply try doing the following ....  \n\u003e\n\u003e Report what happens.  \n\u003e\n\u003e :smile:  \n\u003e Wonko  \nI did exactly as you said and Windows XP (installed on my PC) booted without  \ngiving me that menu for choosing Win XP or Grub4dos ????  \nOne thing... Do I need to install Grub4dos (and copy grldr) on HDD or not? My guess is not.  \nAnother... Do I need to have Grub4dos installed on my PC here at work (cause it\u0027s not installed here)? My guess is not, too.  \nI formated partition as FAT32(sized around 4GB) made it active and the rest of disk was lesft unallocated.  \nWill it make any difference if I try to format it as NTFS?  \nCould it be some problem with my MBR or bootsector?  \nOne more thing. The WD Passport have one hidden partition which in Windows shows up as virtual CD.  \nMaybe that partition is causing problem...  \n\nNew Edit: hmmmmmm I think it\u0027s the problem that BIOS and this HDD don\u0027t like each other.  \nJust went to BIOS and saw that it recognize this HDD as 0.00MB WD SES Device.  \nI pluged in another external I have (Seagate) and it\u0027s recognized as 500GB Seagate.  \nI\u0027ll try to do everything again with this Seagate HDD and report back about results.   \n\n**Edited by tonyzg, 21 March 2011 - 11:31 AM.**\n"

HOWEVER, my personal procedure for making bootable USB HDDs is a bit different than Wonko the Sane\u0027s suggestion. What I do is:  \n\n* Prepare a very small (like 30 MB) FAT16 partition on the USB HDD with Windows.\n* Copy GRLDR to it.\n* Copy a DOS floppy image to it. The DOS floppy contains **FDISK** , **FORMAT** , **SYS** as well as GRUB4DOS.\n* Save the MBR partition table.\n* **DD** the GRUB4DOS MBR to the USB HDD.\n* Restore the MBR partition table.\n* Boot a computer to the USB HDD. It boots GRUB4DOS.\n* Map the DOS floppy image as a RAM disk.\n* Erase the USB HDD MBR with GRUB4DOS.\n* Boot the DOS RAM disk. It obviously boots DOS.\n* Use FDISK to create a nice, FAT32 partition of whatever size I desire. I choose to make it the active partition.\n* FDISK tells me to reboot, but I launch GRUB4DOS, instead.\n* I then boot the DOS RAM disk again. It obviously boots DOS.\n* I FORMAT the new FAT32 partition on the USB HDD.\n* I SYS the new FAT32 partition on the USB HDD to make it bootable.\n* I copy GRUB4DOS to the new FAT32 partition on the USB HDD.\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n"

GRUB4DOS can access them from the NTFS or from the FAT32 partition.  \n\n\u003e On my FAT32 partition I made similar menu.lst entry (the goal is to return to grub4dos on NTFS partition):  \n\u003e\n\u003e ```\n\u003e title Boot NTFS USB\n\u003e\n\u003e rootnoverify (hd0,0)\n\u003e\n\u003e # makeactive\n\u003e\n\u003e chainloader +1\n\u003e ```\n\u003e\n\u003e \u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003e\nOr you could do:  \n\n```\ntitle NTFS Menu\n\n  root (hd0,0)\n\n  configfile /menu.lst\n\n```\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n\u003e And when executed I\u0027m not going directly to menu.lst from NTFS partition but first  \n\u003e I\u0027m given choices from boot.ini. Why I didn\u0027t have this when I executed it to boot to FAT32 partition?  \nYou have to understand what these commands do. **chainloader +1** will load the boot sector from whatever partition you set as the **root** partition.  \n\nPower on -\\\u003e USB HDD MBR -\\\u003e NTFS partition boot sector -\\\u003e NTLDR -\\\u003e BOOT.INI -\\\u003e GRUB4DOS  \n\nFrom there, when you choose the FAT32, you are doing: GRUB4DOS -\\\u003e FAT32 partition boot sector -\\\u003e whatever  \n\nWhen you are going back to the NTFS, you are doing: GRUB4DOS -\\\u003e NTFS partition boot sector -\\\u003e NTLDR -\\\u003e BOOT.INI  \n\nThat is part of why I suggest not doing so much chaining. If you\u0027re running GRUB4DOS already, why not:  \n\nPower on -\\\u003e USB HDD MBR -\\\u003e NTFS partition boot sector -\\\u003e NTLDR -\\\u003e BOOT.INI -\\\u003e GRUB4DOS  \n\nGRUB4DOS -\\\u003e FAT32 menu  \n\nGRUB4DOS -\\\u003e NTFS menu   \n"

I thought that when you change partition you loose Grub4dos and have to boot to it again. So I choose NTFS as first partition because I\u0027m using my NTFS menu.lst apps 95% of time.
