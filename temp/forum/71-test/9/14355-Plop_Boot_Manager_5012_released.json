      "content": "\u003e I think you\u0027re talking about running the PE straight from the USB-??? or will this methode also improve booting speeds for ram loaded images?  \nShould be useful for BOTH approaches.  \nBasically you load (at the \"painfully slow\" USB 1.1 speed the BIOS provides) a smallish image, that boots and then thanks to the \"Kansas City Shuffle\", the booting continues at 2.0 speed (IF the motherboard has the 2.0 chips, of course).  \nThis has traditionally been used on \"direct booting\" only, but now that we have Firadisk and/or WinVblock it should be applicable to ram loaded images too. (it would be IMHO an interesting topic to experiment with this approach)  \nOf course the improvement won\u0027t be that much for \"small\" builds, but it should be very noticeable for \"biggish\" ones, I presume that for anything below and up to 200 Mb there should be very little improvement, but for bigger builds it should be relevant.  \nThe \"temporary image\" you have to load from BIOS (or PLoP) is - if I recall correctly - around 40/50 Mb, there is an actual project that is currently in \"suspended state\":  \n\u003chttp://reboot.pro/6672/\u003e  \nFor a quick test of a PE using this approach, you can have a go with either Fuwi\u0027s app:  \n[http://www.911cd.net...topic\u003d21702\\\u0026hl\u003d](http://www.911cd.net/forums//index.php?showtopic\u003d21702\u0026hl\u003d \"External link\")  \nor with PCuser\u0027s tool for BartPE/UBCD4WIN:  \n[http://ubcd4win.com/...opic\u003d11375\\\u0026st\u003d0](http://ubcd4win.com/forum/index.php?showtopic\u003d11375\u0026st\u003d0 \"External link\")  \n\n@Elmar, sorry for the OT ![:hi:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/hi.gif).  \n\n:wink:  \nWonko   \n"

      "content": "\u003e I think you\u0027re talking about running the PE straight from the USB-??? or will this methode also improve booting speeds for ram loaded images?  \nShould be useful for BOTH approaches.  \nBasically you load (at the \"painfully slow\" USB 1.1 speed the BIOS provides) a smallish image, that boots and then thanks to the \"Kansas City Shuffle\", the booting continues at 2.0 speed (IF the motherboard has the 2.0 chips, of course).  \nThis has traditionally been used on \"direct booting\" only, but now that we have Firadisk and/or WinVblock it should be applicable to ram loaded images too. (it would be IMHO an interesting topic to experiment with this approach)  \nOf course the improvement won\u0027t be that much for \"small\" builds, but it should be very noticeable for \"biggish\" ones, I presume that for anything below and up to 200 Mb there should be very little improvement, but for bigger builds it should be relevant.  \nThe \"temporary image\" you have to load from BIOS (or PLoP) is - if I recall correctly - around 40/50 Mb, there is an actual project that is currently in \"suspended state\":  \n\u003chttp://reboot.pro/6672/\u003e  \nFor a quick test of a PE using this approach, you can have a go with either Fuwi\u0027s app:  \n[http://www.911cd.net...topic\u003d21702\\\u0026hl\u003d](http://www.911cd.net/forums//index.php?showtopic\u003d21702\u0026hl\u003d \"External link\")  \nor with PCuser\u0027s tool for BartPE/UBCD4WIN:  \n[http://ubcd4win.com/...opic\u003d11375\\\u0026st\u003d0](http://ubcd4win.com/forum/index.php?showtopic\u003d11375\u0026st\u003d0 \"External link\")  \n\n@Elmar, sorry for the OT ![:hi:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/hi.gif).  \n\n:wink:  \nWonko   \n"
