      "content": "Hello all, I\u0027ve been hunting around here for a couple months now trying to soak up everything I can about booting from a USB.  \nI\u0027m really at a loss. I\u0027ve tried Sardu, cant\u0027t get it to build a USB booting device, I\u0027ve tried Areo studio also, alot to try and figure out for such a new comer to the scene. I have read and read and read as much as I can, but it just seems I got off the turnip truck. I cant get anything to work. I have had luck booting each iso from oracle virtual box with no problem. but when i try to place them in areo or similar the USB will not boot. It just boots to my regular windows 7 ultimate OS. So here is my question. Could i get someone to a write a menu.lst for me? So I could place it in my USB, because that seems like the most confusing part. I\u0027ve have seen the menu.lst that some have tried, but it just goes over my head.   \nHere is the iso\u0027s that I would like to place on my USB:  \n\nBacktrack4-r2/Hiren_bootCD.10.6/Livehacking_v1.2_beta/Pmagic-5.9/Slitaz-3.0/UBCD503/Unbuntu-10.10-desktop-i386/Windows7ultimate/WindowPE-LiveCD_english/KyrionApplicationPack/Ophcrack  \n\nIf some of these are redundant please omit them.  \nI\u0027m Studying for digital forensics is why i would like to be able to boot all these from a USB, saves having to carry around all these in CD format. If no one cares to do it I understand, its a lot of work. I\u0027ve tried reading the post by pmeadia and others who have tried to write tutorials, but I got lost on the first step and then the rest were like whoa. so?..... any help would really be appreciated.   \n"

I\u0027am trying to install all of this onto a 16gb SanDisk Cruiser. I have used the RMPREPUSB to load g4d onto it using the MS-DOS boot option and a FAT32 filesystem. I tried the xboot and its a novel idea for a drag-n-drop. When i tried to load some of the iso\u0027s that weren\u0027t listed it told me that it I needed to select it from the drop-down list, but alas it was not listed so it wouldn\u0027t let me install the Hiren\u0027s boot CD iso or livehacking iso. When it wanted to test it out it used qem or something like that and it came up with some of the options that I had placed onto it, but it was just like the pen/drive multiboot program for linux. So is there any topics for understanding how to write just menu.lst for any iso one would like add?.  \n\nBTW how do you add a picture on here i see the link for the insert image but it wants a URL. Do I need my own personal URL?  \n\nagain thanks,  \nPaul.   \n"

I tried the RMprepUSB web help but no luck. I did get it to boot from the memory test he suggested to test the USB. IT booted fine, but then again most of the other iso\u0027s will boot also. I have the gldr file, the menu.lst file-,   \n\ntitle memtest86+ v4.1  \nfind --set-root /memtest.img  \nmap /memtest.img (fd0)  \nmap --hook  \nchainloader (fd0)+1   \nrootnoverify (fd0)   \nmap --floppies\u003d1  \n\nand the mt420.iso on the USB disk.  \nThe USB has a u3 system with 6.66 mb CDFS and then a 15.2 gb drive (listed separately)and on the USB itself it has 2.00mb of used space and the rest free. Does that help for any info at all?  \nManually doing it by myself is going to be a hang it up type situation. Not going to happen.   \n\n**Edited by ReBooter, 05 February 2011 - 01:28 AM.**\n"

      "content": "So, first part of booting is OK, meaning that you get to grub4dos choices in menu.lst, right?  \n\nIf yes, you may want to read again this:  \n\u003chttp://reboot.pro/8944/\u003e  \n(same as **shamurshamur** suggested)  \n\nThen start with a method.  \n\nThe suggested one is:  \n\n* list the whatever .iso\u0027s you want to boot\n* choose one, and just one out of the list\n* check if that particular item is ALREADY listed here:  \n  \u003chttp://reboot.pro/5041/\u003e\n* SEARCH the grub4dos forum checking if that particular item has already been talked about\n* IF yes, AND where it is talked there is NOT a solution (or the solution as is doesn\u0027t work for you), THEN post a single, specific request there\n* IF no, start A NEW, single, specific thread in the appropriate Forum:  \n  \u003chttp://reboot.pro/forum/66/\u003e\n* tackle next one in the list\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nBEFORE that, READ the grub4dos guide:  \n\u003chttp://reboot.pro/5187/\u003e  \n[http://diddy.boot-la...os/Grub4dos.htm](http://diddy.boot-land.net/grub4dos/Grub4dos.htm \"External link\")  \nparticularly:  \n[http://diddy.boot-la...iles/basics.htm](http://diddy.boot-land.net/grub4dos/files/basics.htm \"External link\")  \n[http://diddy.boot-la...s/files/cli.htm](http://diddy.boot-land.net/grub4dos/files/cli.htm \"External link\")  \n\nWhen experimenting ALWAYS use Command Line and NEVER a pre-made menu.lst entry (i.e. try using the contents of a menu.lst entry that you find by typing it manually and checking at each line the feedback grub4dos gives you).  \n\nOT, but not much.  \n\nThis is a problem ![:mellow:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/mellow.png):  \n\u003e Manually doing it by myself is going to be a hang it up type situation. Not going to happen.  \neveryone here will try to help you, and a *limited* amount of spoon-feeding assistance is usually given to new members, but do not expect that anyone will do your homeworks.  \nParticularly as a computer forensics student you show - no offence intended :smile: - a preoccupying lack of \"drive\" ![:w00t:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/w00t.gif).  \nAgain, no offence intended whatsoever, but you appear like having a very common misconception, which may be a problem if you really want to continue in this branch, the idea that \"more\" tools available make a \"better\" expert.  \nLots of people think that it\u0027s all about having tools and using them, whilst it\u0027s all about knowledge, something that you can only get with hard work and an inquisitive mind.  \n\nBack to topic.  \n\nThe fact that the stick you are using is an U3 (and has a CD-like device additional to the normal HD-like) may be part of the problem, it is possible that you will need to change something in the menu.lst entries that you find.  \n\n![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif)  \nWonko   \n"

If you have some specific boot iso\u0027s which don\u0027t work, you need to:  \n\n1. Say which ones don\u0027t work (not which ones do work!)  \n2. Give us the menu.lst you are using  \n3.

The needle on the fuel gauge is pointing to the \u0027E\u0027 symbol. How do I fix it?   \n"
