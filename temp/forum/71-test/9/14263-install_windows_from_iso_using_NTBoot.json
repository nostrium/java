      "content": "Hello People,  \n\nI\u0027m having a problem trying to install windows from an ISO file using NTBoot.  \n\nFor now, I have elected to try first with Windows XP, and have gotten as far as step2.  \n\nBelow are my commands trying to install xp:  \ntitle Windows Xp step1  \nroot (hd0,0)  \n(hd0,0)/boot/ntboot/ntboot iso_inst\u003dwinvblk cdrom\u003d(hd0,0)/isos/xpsp3.iso  \nWorks fine.  \n:smile:  \ntitle windows Xp step2  \nroot (hd0,0)  \n(hd0,0)/boot/ntboot/ntboot iso_inst\u003dwinvblk cdrom\u003d(hd0,0)/isos/xpsp3.iso boot\u003dharddisk  \n\nSetup starts, but then complains of not being able to copy files once I click on ok, it looks for the cd-rom in drive j.  \n\n1. How did you using NTBoot manage to have the cdrom present at step 2?  \n1.a are there additional commands that I may be missing?  \n\nI gather if I substitute windows xp for windows 7 and winvblk for vboot or firadisk I\u0027d still get a similar error?  \n\nanswers would be much appreciated!  \n:smile:  \n![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif)   \n"
