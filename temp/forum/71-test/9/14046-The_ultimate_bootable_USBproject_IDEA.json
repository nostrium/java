      "content": "Hi everyone!  \nThis will be my first post here, so I hope you will make me feel welcome. ![:rolleyes:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/rolleyes.gif)  \n\nI have tried almost any USB-MultiBoot application out there, but all with the same result - NOT WORKING AS EXPECTED!  \n\nWhen it comes to install operating systems from USB, I came across, that Windows - especially XP, had problems with booting the Setup - causing a BSOD \"Blue Screen of Death\" after loading setup-files. I believe many have the same issue, if not lucky you ![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif)  \n\nThis what i got in mind:  \n\nMaking a full capable MultiBoot USB with all the windows os installations. (ISO\u0027s or folder)  \n\nPossibility for a user to make his own menu.lts, with a step-by-step guide - making it more user-friendly  \n\nA full menu with all your OS/Tools/etc.  \n\nPossibility to add more OS/Tools/etc. when you need it.  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nHope somebody will work with me on this. I know a little bit about coding, but I\u0027m not a master ![:thumbup:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/thumbup.gif)  \n\nThanks in advance!  \n\nGreetings,  \nDaniel   \n"

Problem is, that the Grub bootloader doesn\u0027t work as expected, giving different erroes.

At least the code is open source and will save you having to start from scratch like I did when I started 2 years ago.  \n\nThere is some sourceforge links to the code repository in the sites forum.  \n\nThere are two projects, 1 - slow but cheep and 2 - fast but a little more work/money to get going.  \n\nWorks with every iso file I have used to date.   \n"
