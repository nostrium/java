Please use only FAT (or FAT16) formatting or Format from your utilities drivers\n\n[http://www.scribd.co...bank-Controller](http://www.scribd.com/doc/24658435/Quick-Start-Guide-for-Flash-Disk-Chipsbank-Controller \"External link\")  \n\nCan someone explain why a different type of formatting could make some UFDs \"unstable\"?  \n\nI experienced something like that when I did zero-out an entire Chipsbank CBM2091 UFD and then restored its disk image. The UFD had worked fine initially but then started to play up on another computer. It was full of sector-read errors. The problem was fixed after low-level format with an UMPtool.   \n"

      "content": "That document is seemingly dated November 2005.  \nIt is very likely that it is obsolete and contains info no longer appliable.  \n\nThere is no particular difference - in the sense of different way of working of the filesystem - between FAT16 and FAT32.  \n\nThe only - very \"light\" possible explanantion may be something in the FORMAT command of XP and the way it accesses the disk. (but I cannot see how this will influence stability)  \n\nOf course NTFS is another thing.  \n\n![:thumbsup:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/thumbsup.gif)  \nWonko   \n"
