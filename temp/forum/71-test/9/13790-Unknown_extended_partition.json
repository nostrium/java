      "content": "Hi,  \n\nI have a WD 500GB drive and was partitioned as follows:  \nsda1 10GB - PRIMARY NTFS  \nsda2 465GB - EXTENDED  \nsda5 90GB - LOGICAL NTFS  \nsda6 60GB - LOGICAL NTFS  \nsda7 90GB - LOGICAL EXT4  \nsda8 4GB - LOGICAL FAT16  \nsda9 6GB - LOGICAL LINUX SWAP  \nsda10 200 - LOGICAL NTFS  \n\nI deleted sda1 and created from the unpartitioned space two other ntfs primary partitions. Named (in gparted) sda1 and sda3. Now, the two primary partitions are readable but the extended one has an \"unknown partition\" problem in gparted and in unreadable.  \n\nThe only backup I had was on sda10 and is unredable. Below I posted a log from testdisk. Please, review it and guide through this as I don\u0027t know what to do.  \n\nThanks for all your help. It will be appreciated.  \n\n[http://tinypaste.com/58917f](http://tinypaste.com/58917f \"External link\")   \n"

      "content": "*if possible restore the previous partitioning scheme*   \n\nCorrect, without a doubt his partition table is messed up. Now the question is how exactly is going to restore it? It would have to be done manually. I hope your suggestion solves the issue and I fully agree that he needs to make a raw backup copy of his whole disk before messing any further.  \n\nThe best thing to do would be to somehow get the data of the broken partition and put it to another. The data isn\u0027t lost, it is still there.  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nIf in case you attempt to use any tool my suggestion is not to make any changes if you don\u0027t know what it\u0027s asking you so you are better of posting the results here.   \n"
