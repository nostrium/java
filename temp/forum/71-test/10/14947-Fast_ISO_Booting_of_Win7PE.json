      "content": "Hi all, I thought I would share something I came across while searching for the fastest way to boot iso file.  \nI use the tools and knowledge found here to help family and friends with their computers, just like many of you I\u0027m sure.  \nMy favorite winbuilder tool has been the LiveXP. I followed tutorial by amalux. It boots in 2min 30sec on cd. I\u0027ve used it   \nmany times. Then comes Windows 7. A new OS that I can still use LiveXP on for some things. Then add 64bit into the mix and   \nnew tools like MSDART to repair and recover Win7 installs, so now I add winbuilder Win7PE. I think it is called Win7PE SE   \nto be exact. Another great tool from the many talented people here. However, booting it from CD was taking over 5min.  \nI used default setting in winbuilder of in-ram bootwim and grub4dos bootloader.I guess I\u0027m impatient but watching that bar  \n\" windows is loading files . . . \" for 5min was driving me crazy!I tried stripped down lean versions of Win7PE but,  \nload times were always about the same.Then I read about the Zalman VE-200. I bought one and started putting all kinds  \nof iso tools on it and they booted!!! Programs too!!! I put the Win7PE iso on it and OH NOOO!! ![:pulpfiction:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/what.gif) 7min and 38sec to boot!!  \nThis is getting longer than I thought so please forgive me. After much experimenting I set winbuilder to build using  \nnormal build (no in-ram bootwim) and normal bootmanager (no grub4dos).I put the resulting iso on the Zalman and I saw   \nthe loading screen and then BSOD. stop0000007b. Then I read this : [My link](http://reboot.pro/9196/page__st__45 \"\")  \n\nThis was from karyonix:  \n\nUse regedit (run as administrator) from other installed Windows.  \nOr boot Windows 7 DVD and press Shift+F10 to open cmd then type regedit.  \nSelect HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE  \nClick menu File, Load Hive...  \nSelect (your USB drive)\\\\Windows\\\\system32\\\\config\\\\system file and Open it.  \nGive it a name sys.  \nBrowse to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\\sys\\\\ControlSetxxx\\\\services\\\\usbehci. Make sure its Start value is 0.  \nDo the same for usbohci, usbuhci, usbhub, usbstor in all ControlSet\\*\\\\services key.  \nSelect HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\\sys  \nClick menu File, Unload Hive...  \n\nI made the changes as detailed to the iso, again saved it to the Zalman and it booted in 1min and 38sec!! ![:smiling9:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/smiling9.gif)   \nTo me this was HUGE !!! I knew the stop was from inaccessible boot device and remembered reading about changing usb start   \nvalues to 0 from 3.  \nEverything works great and it boots sooooo fast!  \nAnyway, that\u0027s what worked for me, maybe for someone else also!!   \n"

Nine out of ten newer machines boot UFD to desktop in well under a minute, occasionally there will be an odd delay in loading RAM, with the loading bar *creeping* across the screen instead of zipping to completion in a few seconds as normal. I admit I don\u0027t understand this behavior, I assume it\u0027s some bottleneck in the system, RAM, ports, controller, drivers etc. I normally don\u0027t have time to investigate further and just pull the UFD, switching to other boot method.   \n\nOlder machines are definitely a problem booting to UFD/USB (especially USB-HD) so I know to avoid USB altogether on those. I think there are other considerations, UFD type/speed, formatting (not just NTFS vs. FAT), PE image type/configuration, grub/BCD setup etc. If I ever have time to fully investigate I\u0027ll be glad to report findings with details.  \n\n![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif)   \n"

So an older or slower CPU may prevent the USB port from reaching it\u0027s full potential.  \n\nWhen booting directly only the very first phase of the boot process uses PIO mode. As soon as the Windows Start screen appears, Windows drivers are used instead of BIOS calls, which means switching to DMA mode in most cases, which puts less strass on the CPU, so a higher speed can be reached with a slower CPU.  \nAlso with direct boot, no dead weight has to be moved.

I bought one and started putting all kinds  \nof iso tools on it and they booted!!! Programs too!!! I put the Win7PE iso on it and OH NOOO!! ![:pulpfiction:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/what.gif) 7min and 38sec to boot!!  \nThis is getting longer than I thought so please forgive me. After much experimenting I set winbuilder to build using  \nnormal build (no in-ram bootwim) and normal bootmanager (no grub4dos).I put the resulting iso on the Zalman and I saw   \nthe loading screen and then BSOD. stop0000007b. Then I read this : [My link](http://reboot.pro/9196/page__st__45 \"\")  \n\nThis was from karyonix:  \n\nUse regedit (run as administrator) from other installed Windows.  \nOr boot Windows 7 DVD and press Shift+F10 to open cmd then type regedit.  \nSelect HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE  \nClick menu File, Load Hive...  \nSelect (your USB drive)\\\\Windows\\\\system32\\\\config\\\\system file and Open it.  \nGive it a name sys.  \nBrowse to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\\sys\\\\ControlSetxxx\\\\services\\\\usbehci. Make sure its Start value is 0.  \nDo the same for usbohci, usbuhci, usbhub, usbstor in all ControlSet\\*\\\\services key.  \nSelect HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\\sys  \nClick menu File, Unload Hive...  \n\nI made the changes as detailed to the iso, again saved it to the Zalman and it booted in 1min and 38sec!! ![:smiling9:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/smiling9.gif)   \nTo me this was HUGE !!! I knew the stop was from inaccessible boot device and remembered reading about changing usb start   \nvalues to 0 from 3.  \nEverything works great and it boots sooooo fast!  \nAnyway, that\u0027s what worked for me, maybe for someone else also!!   \n"

Nine out of ten newer machines boot UFD to desktop in well under a minute, occasionally there will be an odd delay in loading RAM, with the loading bar *creeping* across the screen instead of zipping to completion in a few seconds as normal. I admit I don\u0027t understand this behavior, I assume it\u0027s some bottleneck in the system, RAM, ports, controller, drivers etc. I normally don\u0027t have time to investigate further and just pull the UFD, switching to other boot method.   \n\nOlder machines are definitely a problem booting to UFD/USB (especially USB-HD) so I know to avoid USB altogether on those. I think there are other considerations, UFD type/speed, formatting (not just NTFS vs. FAT), PE image type/configuration, grub/BCD setup etc. If I ever have time to fully investigate I\u0027ll be glad to report findings with details.  \n\n![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif)   \n"

      "content": "@wimb  \n\nI use your make_USB.exe whenever I need to put a project on a flashdrive.I guess Boot_USB.exe must be the newest version.  \nThank you for these tools ![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif) . I noticed that the make_usb tool puts the plop boot manager on the stick when   \ngrub4dos is selected. If I understand what I\u0027ve been reading about plop, it allows USB 2.0 speed to be enabled at   \nbootup. This sounds like what I have been looking for. I loaded the iso from al_jo\u0027s project using make_usb and grub4dos. Here is menu.lst:  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\ntitle Boot Win7rescue.ISO - ISO from RAM  \nfind --set-root --ignore-floppies /Win7rescue.ISO  \nmap --mem /Win7rescue.ISO (0xff)  \nmap --hook  \nroot (0xff)  \nchainloader (0xff)  \n\ntitle PreLoad USB2.0 - via PLoP BootManager  \nroot (hd0,0)  \nkernel /plpbt.bin  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nMaybe you could help me understand this. When I boot the stick I select PreLoad USB2.0 from menu. Then the plop menu comes up. Then I select USB from options. Then the first menu comes back with the Win7rescue.ISO and plop.  \nThis time I select \" Boot Win7rescue.ISO \" . It looks like it is doing something and then a black screen comes up   \nsaying \" finding upper memory \" . I think that is what I remember seeing. It just stays there and nothing happens.  \nMake_USB installed the iso and grub4dos and made the menu.lst. However plop doesn\u0027t appear to be working.I will read up on plop but if this is a problem you have come across I would welcome your help.  \n\nThank you all ![:smiling9:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/smiling9.gif)   \n"

Which part of your reply is suppose to contradict that Plop was designed to fit into the MBR?  \n\n\u003e that makes no sense and that would be pointless to reply to, whether I know   \n\u003e \u003e what requirement this OS would have to meet, that the loaded image could then be hooked\n\u003e (whatever you mean by that ![:confused1:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/confused1.gif)) or not it won\u0027t change anything.\n\u003e\n\u003e \u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003e\nSo i can load an image into a ramdisk with any OS and then use the image to boot XP/Win7 from it? Didn\u0027t knew that. Thought this would only be possible under certain circumstances, guess i\u0027m wrong like usual.  \n\n\u003e # IF you could confirm that it is the same idea ![:dubbio:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/dubbio.gif), I would appreciate it as it would mean that I actually understood what yours was about (or please explain your idea in better detail)  \n\u003e # Since I cannot understand exactly what you are asking about I cannot give you a \"yes or no\" answer, though any of them would be useless anyway.\nSince i\u0027m sure that your english is sufficient for conversation and mine is too, i can only conclude that there must be cultiral differences that keep us from understanding eachother.  \nToo bad.  \n\nHave a nice day!   \n"

      "content": "\u003e Apropos planning. The whole Plop discussion made me think. Shouldn\u0027t it be possible to do the same thing Plop does, just with a better/different OS/drivers?  \n\u003e\n\u003e Plop is a bootmanager and supose to fit into the MBR.  \n\u003e For our purposes, there is no such limit. We could do fine with a floppy sized solution.  \n\u003e\n\u003e Unfortunately i don\u0027t know, what requirement this OS would have to meet, that the loaded image could then be hooked?  \n\u003e Do you? (Please answer only with yes or no. :wink: )   \n\u003e\n\u003e ![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif)  \n\nWell I think kexec-loader is the only alternative I know of to Plop. You should be able to load memdisk as the kernel and whatever iso you want as the initrd. Keep in mind whenever I tried it it always hung on me for some reason with those stupid blinking lights on the keyboard. It probably needs to be updated.   \n"

      "content": "Just tried kexec-loader again, was too intrigued by this alternative. It works great for linux kernels, but anything else will not work. It just prints cannot determine the filetype of /path/to/kernel  \n\nIf this problem can be somehow overcome, it will be an awesome alternative to plop and its inherent buginess I have myself seen on many systems.  \n\nOh and the reason it was always hanging is you absolutely need to give it a proper root before playing with any of the commands. That\u0027s why it was always barfing on me.   \n"

      "content": "Well I\u0027ve been playing with it some more, and instead I\u0027ve taken to using the kexec in knoppix v6.4.4  \n\nMuch more flexibility when I can directly pass parameters to kexec.  \n\nStill doesn\u0027t make much of a difference.  \n\nI think the main problem is that the initrd has some kind of size limitation. It doesn\u0027t seem to load an initrd over a certain size. (I think sha0 had that problem with winkexec as well)  \n\nOk now if \\*that\\* problem can be overcome, we may be in business (I know, famous last words lol)  \n\nBecause it does load grub.exe without a problem, but then when I try to use cat --hex --locate to try and find some fragment of the initrd in memory, there is nothing...   \n"

      "content": "Ok, final comment. Apparently it does work, I was trying to locate non-hex characters as hex...  \n\nBut it still is not enough.  \n\nWhen it kexec\u0027s grub4dos with an initrd, it hangs at the grub\\\u003e prompt, and will not do anything/go any further. Without an initrd, it runs fine, but thats kinda the whole point is to be able to load an initrd. Who knows exactly how many obstacles past this there are, but for the moment I give up. Kexec\u0027ing in general is just too unreliable imho.  \n\n\\*edit\\*  \n\nAlthough on some machines it does not hang and will work properly. I am still sticking with my previous statement though. If a solution does not work properly across all machines, it is no good for my purposes.   \n"
