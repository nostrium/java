Try for yourself and see if you like the idea of having just one portable Windows for ALL your PCs.  \n\nBoth work for me and iMortaluz\u0027s work is revolutionary. Resides in an external USB HDD, it boots Windows 7 to ALL my Five PCs/Laptop at home. I was extremely shocked by and very satisfied with it. ![:idea:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/idea.gif)  \n\nNow AMD has brought us A75 Hudson D3 chipset that supports native USB 3.0. But I have yet to see no confirmation that it supports OS booting that runs at \\~100MB/s transfer speed compared to \\~30MB/s of USB 2.0. ![:cold:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cold.gif)  \n\nCan any of you A75 motherboard owner help us forum members test this MAJOR function and report back? If you were more comfortable with Linux, please run it from this USB 3.0 and tell us how it performs.  \n\nThanks!   \n"
