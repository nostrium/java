I can\u0027t decide, if to go again with a PE or to choose a full Windows to run off the USB-Stick.  \n\nI\u0027m looking for some opinions from members with hands on experience.  \n\nWhat reasons are there to choose a full Windows over a PE? What can it do better? When is it actually a bad idea. Does anyone actually run his full Windows from a USB-Stick or runs it everyone exclusivly from USB-HDD?  \n\nWhat is your experience with your portable Windows, did you ran into any gotchas?  \n\n![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif)   \n"

Using a Win PE is restricted in my case to very narrow scope of Windows prep \\\u0026 service tasks due to known limitations of Win PE compare to real updatable Win install, where one can also install and update any apps at any time.  \n\nI suggest you to try fresh installing Win to VHD, or backup your system HD with all familiar apps to it, then copy the VHD to your (bare metal :smile:) thumb and boot it natively or with Grub4Dos. You can add more Base and Differencing VHDs to the Thumb with various OSs. These VHD files are easy to delete \\\u0026 replace with new ones, no need to install anything to the thumb, just [prepare](http://reboot.pro/15516/ \"\") VHDs correctly, and the speed is about the same as of native Win install to the Thumb.   \n"

      "content": "Fortunately I have much to say about this.  \n\nFor about a month now, I have been experimenting a full blown Windows XP SP3 Professional and a complete Windows 7 Ultimate install on large USB sticks and 160 GB USB hard drives. In this experiment, I have also included a 60 GB SATA II Solid-State USB drive. In total, I have dedicated for this experiment 10 USB storage media of variable characteristics, using two computers:  \n\n* ASUS Eee Top 1602 Touch-Screen, Cpu 1.6 GHz dual-core, RAM 2GB\n* ASRock 755V88+, Cpu 3 GHz dual processor, RAM 2 GB\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nFirst, I prepared an XP-to-USB Install disk by making the necessary modifications to the i368 folder then burnt back to disk.  \n\nFor Win7:\n\n* I downloaded \"NT 6.x fast installer batch scripts by fujianabc\"\n* extracted the package to a LiveXP Target folder\n* created another sub-folder in the LiveXP Target folder and extracted Win7 DVD into it\n* then created my LiveXP-Win7 Install iso-file and burnt it to disk\n\n**Findings:**\n\n* They both install and run smoothly on both computers.\n* To get a typical system behaviour, after inatall, go to your USB disk properties and activate \"Write Caching\" under policies.\n* When the USB disk is attached through a hub, WinXP will still run (with some glitches though) while Win7 will reboot infinitely reporting no error.\n* If no other hard disk in the system is attached to an ATA or SATA port, no pagefile will be created in niether of the systems (WinXP and Win7 alike)\n* If a hard disk is attached to an ATA/SATA port after install, WinXP will create and use a pagefile on it but if later removed, XP will no longer use pagefile even if it is present, until you make a clean install. Instead, if Win7 finds a disk on ATA/SATA port, it will create and use the pagefile; if the disk is later removed, it will report no pagefile; if disk is put back, it will re-create or reuse the pagefile.\n* While the pagefile is present, both WinXP and Win7 will run without any limitations (since USB reads are fast enough while writes are cached)\n* When no pagefile is present, memory-hungry applications like adobe premiere... will freeze and quit during intensive activity.\n* If you have plenty of RAM, then no problen at all.\n* If you install to USB SSD (solid-state-disk) Win7 will not create a pagefile but will treat the entire disk as RAM, thus, ReadyBoost will not be available. Both WinXP and Win7 will run faster. You may forget that your system is running from USB and un-plug it by mistake as I did a couple of times.\n* If you unplug your USB disk and plug it into another PC, WinXP will pop up some errors and try to install some necessary drivers then run acceptably after reboot. In the worst scenario, it will run in safe mode. **Win7 instead**, boots without errors then automatically installs new devices. The first time I did it un-intentionally: when I came back from the office, I plugged the Win7 USB disk on another computer and put it on. When I came back to work on it, instead of Windows XP Home Edition, I found Windows 7 Ultimate. I asked my child who installed Win7 on this computer. I later found-out it booted from the USB disk I brought from the office.\n\nTo my opinion, therefore,**WinPE** systems are extremely limited compared to Full-blown installs, amongst which, I would rather choose **Windows 7** .   \n"

You can add more Base and Differencing VHDs to the Thumb with various OSs.

      "content": "Fortunately I have much to say about this.  \n\nFor about a month now, I have been experimenting a full blown Windows XP SP3 Professional and a complete Windows 7 Ultimate install on large USB sticks and 160 GB USB hard drives. In this experiment, I have also included a 60 GB SATA II Solid-State USB drive. In total, I have dedicated for this experiment 10 USB storage media of variable characteristics, using two computers:  \n\n* ASUS Eee Top 1602 Touch-Screen, Cpu 1.6 GHz dual-core, RAM 2GB\n* ASRock 755V88+, Cpu 3 GHz dual processor, RAM 2 GB\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nFirst, I prepared an XP-to-USB Install disk by making the necessary modifications to the i368 folder then burnt back to disk.  \n\nFor Win7:\n\n* I downloaded \"NT 6.x fast installer batch scripts by fujianabc\"\n* extracted the package to a LiveXP Target folder\n* created another sub-folder in the LiveXP Target folder and extracted Win7 DVD into it\n* then created my LiveXP-Win7 Install iso-file and burnt it to disk\n\n**Findings:**\n\n* They both install and run smoothly on both computers.\n* To get a typical system behaviour, after inatall, go to your USB disk properties and activate \"Write Caching\" under policies.\n* When the USB disk is attached through a hub, WinXP will still run (with some glitches though) while Win7 will reboot infinitely reporting no error.\n* If no other hard disk in the system is attached to an ATA or SATA port, no pagefile will be created in niether of the systems (WinXP and Win7 alike)\n* If a hard disk is attached to an ATA/SATA port after install, WinXP will create and use a pagefile on it but if later removed, XP will no longer use pagefile even if it is present, until you make a clean install. Instead, if Win7 finds a disk on ATA/SATA port, it will create and use the pagefile; if the disk is later removed, it will report no pagefile; if disk is put back, it will re-create or reuse the pagefile.\n* While the pagefile is present, both WinXP and Win7 will run without any limitations (since USB reads are fast enough while writes are cached)\n* When no pagefile is present, memory-hungry applications like adobe premiere... will freeze and quit during intensive activity.\n* If you have plenty of RAM, then no problen at all.\n* If you install to USB SSD (solid-state-disk) Win7 will not create a pagefile but will treat the entire disk as RAM, thus, ReadyBoost will not be available. Both WinXP and Win7 will run faster. You may forget that your system is running from USB and un-plug it by mistake as I did a couple of times.\n* If you unplug your USB disk and plug it into another PC, WinXP will pop up some errors and try to install some necessary drivers then run acceptably after reboot. In the worst scenario, it will run in safe mode. **Win7 instead**, boots without errors then automatically installs new devices. The first time I did it un-intentionally: when I came back from the office, I plugged the Win7 USB disk on another computer and put it on. When I came back to work on it, instead of Windows XP Home Edition, I found Windows 7 Ultimate. I asked my child who installed Win7 on this computer. I later found-out it booted from the USB disk I brought from the office.\n\nTo my opinion, therefore,**WinPE** systems are extremely limited compared to Full-blown installs, amongst which, I would rather choose **Windows 7** .   \n"

Just the working security hive?  \nIn developing Make_PE3.exe I was trying to let 7PE become more like full Windows 7.  \n- At some stage I wished to add printer support to 7PE (not yet realized but it will be possible with some effort ....)  \n- Also I could not let 7PE keep its installed drivers and was not happy that all the time I had to install the missing drivers in 7PE  \n\nImproving 7PE is a rather tough job and it took quite some effort to have working Audio and Video driver and Theme support.  \n\nThen I decided to slim down full Windows 7 using the knowledge obtained in making 7PE  \nIn this way it is possible to solve the two problems of 7PE described above and  \nboot with a Windows 7 VHD of acceptable size and which has the properties of full Windows 7  \n\nThe fact that full Windows 7 will keep its installed drivers and additionally installed programs  \ndoes mean that certainly the system and software hives of full Windows 7 are essential.  \nActually all hives of full Windows 7 are used unchanged in Portable Universal Windows 7 VHD  \n\n![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif)   \n"

I can\u0027t see a personal need for having an OS on a USB key like that.  \n\u003e\n\u003e As far as the drive conversation, we have started using USB HDDs (GoFlex) and take the drive off and put an SSD on it instead.

Windows is crap anyway, but until Linux does everything I need it to do well then, windows it is.  \n\nI only use bootable media via USB Stick if I have a machine beyond repair, or virus removal. I think it is a great idea to run everything from USB Stick, and it is doable at some point. Meaning I think we will see one day some software company come out with an Operating System on a stick, to sell to the masses. However this is exactly what the cell phone companies are doing in a sense.  \n\nThe phone companies are already making preparations for cell phones to dock to computers, My guess is that the cell phone OS \"Android\" and all the possibilities for apps, is going to run the future of computing. I have recently purchased a Droid Incredible 2 phone and \"if I could connect am external monitor, keyboard and mouse It would be great. LOL!!! The computer, wireless internet and cell phone connection in the palm of my hands. Not to mention everything else I can do with it. Yes, it needs a little more storage space (only comes with 16GB) It would be handy if I could connect an external USB HDD to it. I know this is a bit off topic, but hey I\u0027m just throwing it out there.  \n\nAs a computer tech, I struggled with bootable antivirus cd\u0027s and USB Sticks and thought before about trying to make a complete OS that runs from a usb stick. But I am not Bill Gates, and I don\u0027t have a crap pot full of money so my idea would not go anywhere. So I will stick to USB Sticks with XP and or Win 7 on them to just fix computers.

I did run CCleaner in both environments and the results are very close.  \n\nMaanu has caught my interest with his post about EZpcFix,I will have to look at that. You can never have to many tools since some work better the others depending on the type of PC you are working on,   \n"

Not all portables are created equal and very few are specifically designed for use in PE (though most will work fine); try any of the packages [here](http://reboot.pro/4111/ \"\") and let me know what you think. I\u0027m always looking for constructive feedback for improvement; please be specific if reporting issues.   \n"
