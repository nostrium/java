      "content": "In the middle of setting up a bootable USB stick, I accidentally spilt about 1cm of hot sugary coffee into the trackpad of my Dell D620 which immediately powered itself down.  \n\nI immediately turned it upside down \\\u0026 removed the drive caddy. There wasn\u0027t any visible liquid on the surface of the HD label side.  \n\nTo be on the safe side, the caddy/drive was sandwiched between two very large bags of silica gel which went into a plastic bag for 1 week.  \n\nNow when I connect the HD to an external SATA cradle \\\u0026 power it on, Windows 7\u0027s Disk Manager crashes when loading. It recovers as soon as I turn off the cradle.  \n\nRight now I don\u0027t know the extent of the damage to the HD. I need some advice on the best way to progress - should I make a raw image of the HD using TestDisk or..?  \n\nThe drive\u0027s specs are as below \\\u0026 I have a separate HD for the raw image:  \n\nSeagate Momentus 7200.2 120Gb  \n\nModel number  \nST9120823AS  \n\n2 disks  \n3 heads  \n512 bytes/sector  \n16,383/16/63 logical CHS  \n\nThanks.  \n\nDMTelf   \n"
