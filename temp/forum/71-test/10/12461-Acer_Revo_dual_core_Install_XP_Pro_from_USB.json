      "content": "![:hyper:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/hyper.gif) Hi,  \n\nI have previously made up a 1 GB USB memory stick to allow me to install XP Pro onto a single core Acer Revo (model 3600). I followed instructions from a forum (I believe it was this forum...). I did this 6-12 months ago, and I can\u0027t remember exactly which method I used, as I tried several at the time. However, it worked OK, and installed the pre-SP2 XP Pro onto the hard drive, and also allowed me to remove all other operating systems (Linux etc...) from the hard drive. The installation process allowed me to re-partition and re-format the hard drive. The process was similar to how I have done it many times when I have built a new desktop PC.  \n\nI have just tried to use the same USB memory stick to perform the same installation procedure on a dual core Acer Revo (3610 model),. This dual core model was shipped with Linpus Linux on it, and I want to re-partiton and re-format the HD as before, and remove the Linpus OS.  \n\nHowever, it is hanging up in the installation procedure. I have tried to install XP Pro via the USB stick, via a shared drive from a desktop PC over the LAN, and with an external DVD ROM drive attached via a USB interface to the Revo. None of these have worked. If I try and use the shared drive from a PC on the LAN, the Linpus OS can not read the file formats on the MS XP Pro installation disk. If I use an external DVD ROM drive on a USB interface, the installation starts, but hangs up with a BSOD and error messages of either 0x0000007E or 0x0000007B.  \n\nIf I just use the USB stick directly, the installation routine goes into an infinite loop, starting with one line of text appearing on the monitor stating :-  \n\nStarting cmain() ...  \n\nThen the monitor goes blank, a monitor message flashes up stating that there is no graphics signal to the monitor, and then a couple of beeps and the \"Starting cmain() ...\" text appears again. This keeps looping indefinitely.  \n\nSomehow, the hardware and Linpus installation on this dual core Revo is behaving differently to the older, single core Revo that I installed many months ago. The USB stick/procedure is not working.  \n\nSo, does anyone know how I can make a fool-proof USB memory stick up that will allow me to boot the XP Pro installation software from USB, and go through the usual re-partitioning and re-formatting of the HD from scratch (just like building a new PC with a new HD)?  \n\nI have not changed the files on the USB stick since I used it to install my single core Revo, and I did enter the BIOS to set the boot priorities to force it to boot from USB, (later CD ROM forst for te external DVD ROM drive method), and then HD.  \n\nAre there any Acer Revo dual core (3610) users out there that have successfully installed XP Pro via a USB stick? I have a copy of the original XP Pro (pre-SP2) installation disk, with installation key-code, plus another installation disk which includes SP2, but I have lost the installation key code for that one.  \n\nI previously had problems with needing to install a driver to emulate IDE HD protocols for installing onto a system that used a SATA interface HD. This driver was added to the USB memory stick.  \n\nI do not know what the problem is with this USB stick installation, so I am unsure of where to try and tackle the problem.  \n\nAll opinions or ideas would be welcomed on this one.  \n\nCheers,  \n\nRob   \n"

I thought that I had posted here. How did you find my previous thread?  \n\nI looked at the thread in the URL that you mentioned, and I think it has liberated the solution that I am looking for.  \n\nThe SATA controller is set to \"IDE Emulation mode\", as required. However, there is a setting that causes a USB memory stick to be emulated as either a floppy drive or a hard drive. If it is set to \"Auto\", it emulates the USB memory stick as a floppy drive (if smaller than 2 GB), or a hard disk drive (if it is bigger than 2 GB). I re-set this to \"force hard disk drive emulation\", as my USB stick is only 1 GB, and it was auto-emulating to be a floppy drive.  \n\nI then went into the list for setting the booting priority for the hard disk drives, and the \"USB hard disk\" is listed there, along with the original hard disk drive. It did not show this before. I set the USB hard disk emulation as the first priority for booting, and re-booted. It has now brought me to the light blue \"Part 1\" screen, as it did when I did the previous installation on the single core Revo many months ago.  \n\nI have not gone through the installation yet, as it is still sat there waiting for me to take the next step. I will try that now, and see if it progresses to \"Part 2\" and the rest, as I expected.  \n\nHow do I finalise a thread when I think the problem has been sorted?  \n\nCheers,  \n\nRob   \n"

      "content": "Hi, Steve,  \n\nThis is over a year ago, and my memory is not clear on this. I did follow the points in post #3 (above). Check that one, as a lot of what I read there rings a bell. I did a lot of that before getting the Revo to recognise the USB stick and boot from it.  \n\nThe HAL.DLL thing ws inportant.  \n\nAlso, there was some sort of issue wit hthe 160 GB hard drive being pre-partitioned into four \"logical\" drives (partitions). One of them had Linux still on it, and anther had some \"restore\" files, or something. I eventually accessed te BIOS, and deleted all four partitions, so that therte was only one (unformatted) partition. This then worked when I tried to boot from the USB stick. It was also necessary to get the BIOS set to boot from USB first, and therfe was an issue with needing a SATA driver in amongst the installation files on the USB key before I could finally get the installation to recognise the hard drive. I can not remember all of te stuff that I did back then, as I tried a LOT of methods, and only the last one worked!  \n\nSorry I can not be of more help, but my memories of what I did, and what eventually worked are very dim.  \n\nLook above to posting #3. I am sure that one was helpful.  \n\nRegards,  \n\nRob   \n"

For information, I managed to get the mass driver sorted a couple of years ago thanks to jaclaz, and have since rebuilt XP on a 4Gb Flash Voyager USB again this year (after a few teething problems). You can read it [here](http://www.msfn.org/board/topic/153159-problem-with-install/ \"External link\") if interested...  \n\nInstead of using BartPE to make the local disk into a removable disk, I just used USB_MultiBoot_10 and targeted the installation to my new partition.   \n\nMy XP source was already on a different partition if the same drive, and the creating of XP on the other partition took no time at all to do. I still have a \"real USB\" version, and after comparing the two (partition on HDD against USB) they now look identical... whether that means it will work or not is a different matter.  \n\nFor sure I will post again on here the results the next time I need to do an install (might just do one anyway to see if it works!). ![:smiling9:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/smiling9.gif)  \n\nWould be lovely to have an XP install from my partition on the WD Passport... saves carrying the USB stick around and.... well, it\u0027s just pretty cool thing to have!!!  \n\nThanks again!   \n"
