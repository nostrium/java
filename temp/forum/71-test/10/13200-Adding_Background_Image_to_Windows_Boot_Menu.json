      "content": "For years Windows boot menu offered just plain black screen with the list of items to boot taken from boot.ini file. And currently there is no option in MS BCD edit tools or EasyBCD GUI to Windows Bootmanager to add a background image to Windows boot menu, similar to GFXmenu program for Grub.  \n\nAnyone knows an application that would help doing that, and generally customizing in that sense BCD Boot Menu in Win7 and XP?  \n\nOr, is it possible to add a wallpaper manually - how exactly? I was looking for such solution all over the web, but the only solutions found were on how to change Windows Logo showing up at boot. What pic size \\\u0026 resolution are allowed for BCD Menu? How it depends on your monitor screen size \\\u0026 resolution?  \n\nIf there is no such app or method, can someone consider developing one? Pls do not suggest to use Grub4DOS \\\u0026 GFXmenu instead. I\u0027m keenly aware of such option. The question is how to customize Win BCD Boot Menu if a chance exists. Pls do not say, its impossible, as many other apps discussed on this forum prove anything is possible if you want to make it happen hard enough.   \n"

EasyBCD despite being a GUI doesn\u0027t offer anything BCD GUI related - ironic? Grub4DOS is an advanced boot tool, but for a novice its not suitable IMHO.\n\nOK, so you started with an easy to use GUI tool to make a boot menu, but found it lacking.  \n\u003e Not sure if its possible to add multilevel menus to Grub4DOS, but I like easy way and a range of advanced options EasyBCD GUI currently offers.\nSo, now we might really be getting to the real issue...You want a simple, easy way to configure and create a menu structure...  \n\u003e So I\u0027d rather use BCD short menu list as a front end, and a much longer Grub4DOS menu as a back end. Yet I want the front menu look as attractive as the back one.\nWhy do you tell others HOW to do this? I know it is a trend too many of US (me included at times ![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif) ) have. What we need instead is to describe WHAT you want to see and use, and not how it gets created.  \n\u003e As to Win BCD, whether you like it or not, it remains (and I suspect will always remain in its evolved form) the most popular boot manager on earth for whatever reason, despite majority of Win users might not even know it exists. :smile:\nYes, it might be most USED due to being the default for Windows Vista/7, but is it the most popular in terms of people who customize boot menus? Not so sure. AND if there was an easier to use process, does it really matter to them what the technology is?  \n\u003e Hence, I don\u0027t quite get your aggression with regards to it. Why not try to make it more suitable for user needs? You say its impossible? But GFXmenu isn\u0027t just a GUI to Grub, its a substantial code enrichment to it. Yet it didn\u0027t make Grub disappear.\nBUT, Wonko\u0027s point was that it was added as a part of GRUB. SysLinux/IsoLinux also has a nice (and easy) way to do menus with graphical background (the whole vesamenu.c32) and was added as an EXTENSION to a set of code covered by GPL so that anyone COULD do it.  \n\nNow, could anyone write a NEW bootloader that used the BCD file (or even Boot.ini) and replaced the CLOSED SOURCE, PROPRIETARY code that M$ uses? Of course they could, but then it\u0027s not really what you ***implied*** in the original posting.  \n\u003e Hence this thread invitation remains open. Let\u0027s try to make BCD a bit user friendly with some new tools. :wink:\nA BCD file is a set of (binary) instructions to the bootloader called BOOTMANAGER that belongs to M$...   \n\nHave you looked at things like SysLinux? It is used quite successfully to do multi-level things in UBCD (which has GRUB menus too) as well as PartedMagic...  \n\nSo let\u0027s try to approach this from a WHAT you want, and not how it gets accomplished...  \n\nIs what you want the ability for a simple to configure menu? A GUI to do that? or ???   \n\nDoes it have to use a BCD file? or just has to be easy...  \n\nKeep an open mind, and maybe you\u0027ll get some good discussion ![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif) and pointers...  \n\nScott   \n"

Isn\u0027t FreeDOS based on MS DOS? ![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif)\nI guess because no one thought of it that way...Why make a NEW bootloader to mimic the one that M$ built and uses the same syntax as M$ but with extensions.  \n\nHowever, in the commercial world this is OFTEN the model used. Make a new tool to do the same thing as the main competition AND use their syntax so that the users who know that tool can just drop in YOUR replacement and not have to learn anything new except the extensions you provide.  \n\nAs I implied above, if you just look at some examples of the kinds of menus that have been made (just to manage the menu part of things, you will see that both GRUB (in all it\u0027s flavors) as well as things like SysLinux have some pretty amazing capability. And no, I hadn\u0027\u0027t looked at EasyBCD is some time, but I did try to follow on the links posted above, and saw some other tools mentioned as well...  \n\nBut at the end of the day, it all comes down to finding the right parameters to apply to find and then jump to the actual bootloaders for the OS you want to boot. In fact, that is sort of what they did in the development of the \"easyLODR\" [Diagrams and Explainations](http://neosmart.net/wiki/display/EBCD/Windows+XP \"External link\") of what NeoSmart did...They build a special \"loader\" that reads BOOT.INI things to load in older XP style boot entries. I also has a good (it simplistic) diagram of the whole boot process, etc.  \n\nSo maybe what we need to think about are the types of editing you think you need...  \n\nHave you looked at the [AeroStudio Fourm here](http://www.boot-land.net/forums/index.php?showforum\u003d72 \"External link\")? It also has some nifty tools and builds on top of the lower level tool that does the chaining to the boot loaders of the OS.   \n"

Basically, it takes a little organization, and they set up different files for each level of menu, and an entry on that menu to jump back to the main menu.  \n\nThey use that for the Iso/SysLinux stuff too, although that system has a build in syntax to make a submenu and exit back to the top level. Look at their [wiki on menu.c32](http://syslinux.zytor.com/wiki/index.php/Comboot/menu.c32 \"External link\")  \n\n```\nMENU BEGIN \u0026#91;tagname\u0026#93;\n\nMENU END\n\n\t\tBegin/end a submenu. The entries between MENU BEGIN and MENU END form a submenu, which is marked with a \u003e mark on the right hand of the screen. Submenus inherit the properties of their parent menus, but can override them, and can thus have their own backgrounds, master passwords, titles, timeouts, messages and so forth. \n\n\n\nMENU GOTO tagname\t \u0026#40;Only valid after a LABEL statement.\u0026#41; \n\n\t\tThis label will transfer to the named submenu instead of booting anything. To transfer to the top-level menu, specify \u0026#34;menu goto .top\u0026#34;.\n```\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nIt also has pointers to their even MORE complex, compiled into code, menu system.  \n\u003e I have a concept of AeroStudio as ISO Menu Tool.

I used to have to toggle switches to load the intial loader (on a PDP-8) and even had to press a button on the IBM machine we had at College to load a single punch card that had the instructions on how to read more cards into memory and then jump to a fixed location (we just loaded)...  \n\nToday, it is no different, we load a BIOS in the HW, that then loads a program, that loads a program, etc...   \n"

      "content": "So now from hot rhetoric we know that Windows BCD is a bootmanager config file, it can be decrypted, presented as plain text, and a reference to a background picture can be added to it. Yet it won\u0027t be processed and sent to display by MS Bootmanager (being merely a Bootloader :smile: ), because it was not designed to do such graphics or customization things. Hmmm... Why MS, despite allowing to modify a list of systems to boot via boot.ini for many years, never provided a user with means to nicefy its appearance? May be because needing a choice of OSs to boot is an extraordinary event for a typical Windows user?  \n\nReturning to multilevel menus, I wonder if its possible to adapt to Grub4DOS (will test if it works thereafter) these menu files\u0027 sections used in the linked above Super Grub Disk, thus bypassing the need to create for this a Win FreeBootmanager (being in-fact FreeBootloader with extensions ![:dubbio:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/dubbio.gif) ):  \n\nMENU.LST  \n\ndefault 0  \ntimeout 2  \nsetgrubdevice # This is compulsory  \n#sgdgfxmenu /boot/grub/message  \nforeground ffffff  \nbackground 0c00ff  \n\ntitle Super Grub Disk  \n# The two commands: setgrubdevice and usbshift are needed  \n# so that SGD works well.  \nusbshift  \nconfigfile $(grub_device)/boot/sgd/sgd.lst  \n\n---------------------------------------------------  \n\nSGD.LST  \n\ncolor white/brown yellow/cyan  \ndefault 2 # Go directly to SGD menu  \nforeground ffffff  \nbackground 0c00ff  \ncolor white/blue yellow/cyan  \n#splashimage\u003d/boot/sdg/gotera14.xpm.gz  \n#gfxmenu /boot/grub/message  \n\ntitle \\\u003c--Main Menu.lst  \ncatis off  \nconfigfile $(grub_device)/boot/grub/menu.lst  \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------   \n"

How such programmed stats manipulation corresponds to a concept of open mind and open \"Boot Anything Anywhere\" website project? It looks like someone suspects this thread to become the most popular among users.\nStats are collected to a light storage and then periodically written only once at the main database. If you had looked closely to other topics before stating such claim, you\u0027d see this behavior on them as well.  \n\nThousands of people visit hundreds of topics around here on daily basis. Updating the tables just for adding a single page view is a costly operation in terms of CPU/RAM and this measure improves the forum performance.   \n\nIf you have similar questions, I\u0027d appreciate if you could post them on the [site feedback](http://www.boot-land.net/forums/index.php?showforum\u003d75 \"External link\") section so that we can keep focus on the topics discussed here.  \n\n![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif)   \n"

All forum communication is usually caused by either curiosity (or another kind of desire) or necessity. ![:victory:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/victory.gif) I especially like to deal with smart and knowledgeable ones, despite they\u0027re often harder to deal with due to some inherent conflict with surrounding \"society\". Lets leave it to psychoanalysts to dissect. :smile: Your knowledge sharing on various forums is by itself IMHO a valuable contribution since it leads to educating others thus pushing society progress. So you DO PUSH others forward, but critique others for doing the same! Is that enough - its up to you to decide, but it doesn\u0027t seems to lead to a countable accomplishments list. I just extend you an open invitation to contribute in a more diverse way. Do you need such an invitation - who knows... Could not possibly minimize your work, as I couldn\u0027t get **any highlight** of it from you. Always appreciate getting a competent answer from you on direct questions (without irrelevant comments). ![:beer:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/beer.gif)  \n\nWhen it comes to pushing progress, what I noted, inventions nowadays ain\u0027t come out the blue either. There is always someone or something \"pushing\" the able ones to re-invent the wheel. Indeed, the life is harsh in that sense. :wink:   \n"
