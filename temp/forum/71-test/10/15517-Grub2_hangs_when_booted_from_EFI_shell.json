On the USB, I have stored all the grub modules, grub.efi,grub.cfg and also the kernel image to load. When I execute grub.efi, I get the grub menu on screen. When I select a menu entry, it gets hung.  \nThe below is the commands which i execute from the shell.  \nfs0:x86_64-boot\\\\x86_64-grub\\\\grub.efi  \n\nwhen I add debug\u003dall in the menu entry, at the end of logs, i get the following:  \n**GOP success and it hangs**   \n\nI tried adding set gfxpayload\u003d640x480 in menu entry but the behaviour remains the same.   \n"
