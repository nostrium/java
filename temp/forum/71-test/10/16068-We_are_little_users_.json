If the media does have an MBR, only one partition is supported. There is **little user**-discernible difference between MBR-partitioned media and superfloppies.   \n\u003e\n\u003e Examples of removable media include floppy disk drives, JAZZ disk cartridges, magneto-optical media, DVD-ROM, and CD-ROM. Hard disk drives on external buses such as SCSI or IEEE 1394 are not considered removable.\n\n![:rofl:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/roll1.gif)  \n\n:wink:   \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif)  \nWonko   \n"
