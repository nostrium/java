      "content": "Newish release of gujin has a feature that may be of interest.  \n[http://gujin.sourceforge.net/](http://gujin.sourceforge.net/ \"External link\")  \n[http://sourceforge.net/projects/gujin/](http://sourceforge.net/projects/gujin/ \"External link\")  \n\nAmong other things:  \n\u003e After version 2.5, it is also possible to give as target of the instboot installer  \n\u003e an ISO image, so that this ISO image file will be modified to enable to copy  \n\u003e it onto a SD card or USB key and boot like a CDROM.  \n\u003e Basically a new FAT filesystem (by default FAT12 of 320 Kbytes) is  \n\u003e concatenated at the end of the ISO file and the first 512 bytes of the ISO  \n\u003e file (usually blank) is replaced by the first sector of the FAT filesystem.  \n\u003e You have what I call an ISO+FAT filesystem image, and you can mount each of  \n\u003e them with the standard mount -o loop (add offset\u003dsize_of_iso_in_byte for FAT).  \n\u003e The installer also build the sector load chain, so it cannot be just a \"dd\"   \n\u003e command. The added FAT contains the full Gujin bootloader which will detect   \n\u003e the ISO image, create the simulated disk of El-Torito and run it automatically.  \n\u003e The simpler is to test, for instance download the easypeasy-1.0.iso   \n\u003e distribution (save easypeasy-1.0.iso in a safe place, and work on  \n\u003e a temporary copy - the \\*.iso file will be modified) and type (after inserting   \n\u003e a SD card of sufficient size into the \"special\" SD slot):  \n\u003e ./instboot boot.bin easypeasy-1.0.iso  \n\u003e umount /dev/mmcblk0  \n\u003e cat easypeasy-1.0.iso \\\u003e /dev/mmcblk0  \n\u003e If you want to use a USB key or do not have the \"special\" SD slot but only a   \n\u003e USB SD card adapter, detect on which /dev/sd\\* port it is, and type instead:  \n\u003e umount /dev/sdg  \n\u003e cat easypeasy-1.0.iso \\\u003e /dev/sdg  \n\u003e If you insert that card/key into an EeePC (with an up-to-date BIOS), you will   \n\u003e first boot Gujin (first displayed line) and automatically (if you do not press   \n\u003e a key) boot the El-Torito bootloader.  \n\u003e Obviously this SD card or USB key is erased by this process, do not use a key   \n\u003e with important files on it.  \n\u003e As usual, some PC may not boot SD cards, or SD cards in USB adapter, or USB   \n\u003e drive - you can try on those:  \n\u003e ./instboot boot.bin easypeasy-1.0.iso --disk\u003dEBIOS:0x80,auto  \n\u003e If you find another use for the FAT filesystem created, you can increase its   \n\u003e size by the standard --fs\u003d\\\u003cnb_sectors\\\u003e parameter.  \n\u003e If your favorite distribution boots, but stops after some time because it  \n\u003e does not find the root filesystem (i.e. the rest of the distribution files) on  \n\u003e any inserted CDROM, you may tell the distribution manager to mount his  \n\u003e root filesystem by filesystem name instead of forcing \"/dev/cdrom\".  \n\u003e If you are deseperably looking to report a bug, you can also complain  \n\u003e that such a distribution on a SD card open the CDROM tray in the power  \n\u003e down process.\n\nThe idea seems nice ![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif)  \n\n\"easypeasy\" is here:  \n[http://sourceforge.n...cts/ubuntu-eee/](http://sourceforge.net/projects/ubuntu-eee/ \"External link\")  \n\njaclaz   \n"

      "content": "I think the developer of gujin got the idea from isolinux. ![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif)   \nIsolinux has a isohybrid script that does something similar. It won\u0027t create a fat partition though, but you can add that yourself afterwards.  \n\u003e ++++ HYBRID CD-ROM/HARD DISK MODE ++++  \n\u003e\n\u003e Starting in version 3.72, ISOLINUX supports a \"hybrid mode\" which can  \n\u003e be booted from either CD-ROM or from a device which BIOS considers a  \n\u003e hard disk or ZIP disk, e.g. a USB key or similar.  \n\u003e\n\u003e To enable this mode, the .iso image should be postprocessed with the  \n\u003e \"isohybrid\" script from the utils directory:  \n\u003e\n\u003e isohybrid filename.iso  \n\u003e\n\u003e This script creates the necessary additional information to be able to  \n\u003e boot in hybrid mode. It also pads out the image to an even multiple  \n\u003e of 1 MB.  \n\u003e\n\u003e This image can then be copied using any raw disk writing tool (on Unix  \n\u003e systems, typically \"dd\" or \"cat\") to a USB disk, or written to a  \n\u003e CD-ROM using standard CD burning tools.  \n\u003e\n\u003e The ISO 9660 filesystem is encapsulated in a partition (which starts  \n\u003e at offset zero, which may confuse some systems.) This makes it  \n\u003e possible for the operating system, once booted, to use the remainder  \n\u003e of the device for persistent storage by creating a second partition.\n\n"
