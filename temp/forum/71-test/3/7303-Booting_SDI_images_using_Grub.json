      "content": "Hi ALL Builders! Here I am again. ![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif)   \n\nI don\u0027t know if my post is suitable in here.  \nI just hope the Board will okey for this particular post of mine...  \n\nIt is because it has portion of a successfull of building my Multiboot DVD.   \n(Booting to 3 BootSDI.img, AcronisMediaRecovery.iso, and my DOS utilities.)  \nIt has a portion of little \"How To\", and a portion for a help from Jaclaz.. about   \nincorporating a little code of GRUB in my MultiBoot DVD.  \n\nBefore I continue, I just wanna say THANKS to Thuun for his GOOD work in \"CreateBcdwPE.Script\".  \nBecause without this script, my build will not be realized.  \nAnd also thanks to Jaclaz who help me in my last post. I already using it. It gives me a BIG help  \nin fixing PC\u0027s as for my way of living.  \nAnd now that I successfuly build my MultiBoot DVD, I don\u0027t how to express my joy and how to say   \nTHANK you Builders..  \nI already using it for almost a month now. It saves time in repairing computers.  \n\nAnd now I would say my joy begins here...  \nAfter I downloaded \"CreateBcdwPE.Script\" [http://www.boot-land...mp;showfile\u003d152](http://www.boot-land.net/forums/index.php?autocom\u003dDownloads\u0026showfile\u003d152 \"External link\")  \nby Thuun, I then browse to my archive files of different version of Winbuilders, from my backup Hard Disk.  \nI run the script for the very first time. then I burned the \"LiveXP.iso\" result, It almost makes my eyes wide open   \nlike the \"Power puff girls eyes\" in excitement saying \"got ya..\" ![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif) Booting to SDI.img in CD/DVD will be possible now... ![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif)   \n\nBeacuse my plan is booting to multi SDI images,by choosing which image I want to boot to.   \n(Depending the size of physiacl memory of the Mother Board itself).  \nI run the script to every version of WB. Then I choosed the \"lx101408cxs\" which is good for me.  \nAnd I Keep experimenting with it, customizing to suit my needs. Until it gives me a \"Thumbs Up\" ![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif)   \n(see pic1 \\\u0026 pic2 from attachment)  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nAnd here is a little How TO...(Only to those who didn\u0027t know it yet)....(Like ME) He...He.... ![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif)   \nBTW, I using the BootSDI.img build from this version \"lx101408cxs\" (sorry I forgot where \\\u0026 who\u0027s signature it was,   \nmaybe from Amalux, or Lancelot. Thanks anyway to both).  \n\nI provided you my ready-made \"Bootable iso\" just to give you a ittle time for this.  \n\nBy the way, for those who didn\u0027t know it yet, (no offense.. He..he..) I got the BootSDI.img from ISO folder in Ram subfolder then inside I386 subfolder (e.g. C:\\\\lx101408cxs\\\\ISO\\\\Ram\\\\I386). Of course the path differs from yours.  \n\nJust rename your images (if you want 3 images) to the names \"WinPE.img, WinSD.img \\\u0026 WnSDI.img.   \nYou can use one image if you want.  \n\nJust read the \"Readme.txt\" (attachment) for more info of my images.  \n\nOpen \"LiveXP.iso\" (attachment) in PowerISO. Then \"Drag \\\u0026 Drop\" your images..  \ninside the I386 folder in the opened PowerISO programs.  \n\nNote...  \n\nDO NOT EDIT ANYTHING INSIDE THE LiveXP.iso. Just add your images into it.(See Pic3 for reference).  \nExcept if you use other name for the DOS.ima image, You must edit the \"bcdw.ini\" entry.  \n\nDo not edit the 3 SETUPLDR.BIN (R,S,\\\u0026 T) if you used the names of 3 images I provided. You can experiment it later on.  \nI already edited it to correspond the name of my 3 images. (WinPE.img, WinSD.img \\\u0026 WnSDI.img)  \nAlso do not edit the 3 SIF files... WINPE.SIF, WINSD.SIF \\\u0026 WNSDI.SIF. (see pic4)   \nYou can open it with the notepad to see it, So simple Duh!.  \n\nAfter you finish adding your images, you can save it if you want, then press the burn icon button in PowerISO.   \nOf course, you must see to it that your New LiveXP.iso will fit CDR/W disc. if not used DVDR/W instead.  \n\nThen you can restart your PC and boot from it.  \n\nAnd that is all Guys..I hope somebody find it usefull as I did.  \n\nAnd my last portion is this. just simple. I hope Jaclaz will response, because he is ONE of an expert in GRUB..  \n\n\"How can I incorporate Grub\" in bcdw.ini? I want to have the 6th option that when I select it, (see pic1)  \nit gives me another option \"Start GRUB4DOS Menu\", then it gives another option from the Menu.lst..  \n\"Boot from RAMDISK\" for just one SDI.img to boot from.  \n\nAnyway, I\u0027m contented with my current build, I just want to know which is good in booting SDI.img. (The BCDW or GRUB)  \nI prefer SDI.img only because it boots faster than normal iso.  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nThanks in advance Jaclaz. I know its just a \"Tip of an Iceberg\" for you.  \nAnd MORE power to you and the rest of the builders...You are ALL a part of my success...(Someday!!! He...he..) ![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif)   \n\nAriom..   \n\nP.S. I hope Jaclaz can make a \"script\" also like Thuun did in his \"CreateBcdwPE.Script\". ![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif)   \n\nMy attacment ~~is~~ **was** [Here](http://www.nowhere.no \"External link\")   \n"
