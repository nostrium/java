      "content": "Hi, I need some advise here.  \n\nTrying to boot some 4 and 8Gb USB Flash Drives with a BootCD image.  \n\nNo problems on notebooks, but on a desktop pc based on a Gigabyte GA-945GCM-S2L MB, Intel 945, the error is always something with GRLDR missing. When MBR try all the HDs, it does not find a FAT32 partition, and when it try fd0 correctly identity as FAT32 but don\u0027t find GRLDR.  \n\nFormatted with NTFS it has no problems, but keep booting as fd0. The bootlace parameter MB --mbr-disable-floppy shouldn\u0027t avoid this behaviour?  \n\nThe same UFDs were bootable with WinPE when formatted with FAT32 and XP MBR, so seems that GRLDR MBR has some issues with some BIOS (or vice-versa).  \n\nTried all possible format tools, converting UFD file system, FAT16, 32, cluster sizes, fixed bit, grub4dos versions, etc. Also tried force boot it as USB-ZIP, USB-CDROM, USB-HDD, USB-FDD. I\u0027m missing a \u0027please UFO\u0027s get me out of here\u0027 option ![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif) .  \n\nAny help would be appreciated! I\u0027m pretty sure that I\u0027m not the only one with this issue.  \n\nRegards!   \n"

Press Ctrl+Alt+Delete to restart.  \n\nAfter this I even modified byte 5EH directly on MBR (Partition number), same results.  \n\nBIOS is latest, 2008/09/05.  \n\nI can provide any other info.
