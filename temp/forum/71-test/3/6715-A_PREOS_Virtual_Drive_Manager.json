      "content": "I\u0027m looking for an application that I thought would be pretty easy to find but apparently nobody has thought of this idea.   \n\nI\u0027m a computer technician, and as one, I carry around discs. Applications, operating systems and rescue discs, as well as drivers and backups.   \nLast month I bought brand new portable external hard drive with 320GB of space and I couldn\u0027t be happier, all those CDs/DVDs I use to carry around with me, I can now just make into ISOs and use DAEMON Tools or Power ISO to mount them as a virtual drive.  \n\nThe problem is, I can\u0027t do this with BOOTABLE discs.   \nSo I still need to carry around all my rescue discs and operating system install discs.  \n\nI WISH there was a program that I can install on my external drive, along with a folder called ISO\u0027S that whenever I connect my external hard drive to a new computer, I choose to boot from it and it loads a virtual drive and gives me a list of the ISOs files available on the folder.  \n\nI choose the ISO, and the program boots from it.   \n\n**A PRE-OS Virtual Drive Manager!**   \n\nThat would save me so much time and make my job a lot easier, plus I can stop carrying discs around and just use my hard drive for everything!  \n\nHas anybody seen anything like that around? Anything at all?   \n\nPlease let me know!   \n"

      "content": "This sounds very interesting but haven\u0027t heard of such elaborate tool yet.  \n\nIf you interested in beginning such project it might certainly grow popular.  \n\n--------  \n\nTo load ISO\u0027s I\u0027d recommend Imdisk (the developer is a member here) - it\u0027s open source and very flexible.  \n\nFor the ISO boot portion it gets a bit more complicated since each ISO has it\u0027s boot characteristics.  \n\nGrub4Dos could be used to handle multiboot (the developer is also a member here) without worries but it would require some tweaking on the settings.  \n\n----------------------------  \n\nSince you\u0027re proposing a front end to all these things, it would be fun to see a sort of wizard asking the user some basic questions about the ISO image that he would like to add and this way arrange all the necessary settings to add the image onto the external harddrive (ready to boot if desired).  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nDamian666 is usually available for creating these sort of tools, if you need help coding the frontend then he might be the right person.  \n\n:smile:   \n"

      "content": "Yes, I am always dreaming about a *pre-boot operating system* , perhaps including to kick out legacy BIOS and to completely rewritten as Open Source.  \n\nBut what you ask for doesn\u0027t exist. Well, there are workarrounds. A workarround is never a replacement.  \n\nBooting CD\u0027s on computers with function able BIOS to boot CD is a 100 % portable solution, I\u0027ve seen only rare cases where this isn\u0027t working.  \n\nBuggy BIOS and USB booting problems are common. There are workarrounds but not 100 % replacement.  \n\nLike mentioned grub4dos can be used to emulate an iso (CD or DVD) at boot time to an boot it. But it\u0027s \"only\" (in quotes, because this is already great) 100 % portable as long only real mode operating systems access the device thought BIOS calls. As soon a protected/long mode operating system will try to direct access the device it will fail as it does not exists in reality and there is no driver. (However, with great effort it would be possible to develop such a feature.)  \n\nThere are operating system specific workarrounds available (xp setup from usb, PEtoUSB, transfering linux live cd\u0027s to usb, USBoot...).  \n\nAnother option is to use USB pendrives with a \u0027good\u0027 firmeware, a few of them are capable of emulating a CD-ROM and it will look \u0027real\u0027 to the operating system, so it\u0027s bootable. But a lot limitations, currently only pendrives, no USB HDD, only 1 CD (maybe workarround multi boot cd) pendrive, USB-CDROM booting problems have been inherited (buggy/old BIOS\u0027s). This area is also very experimental.  \n\nIt all involves a lot learning and trouble, like said there is no 100 % replacement for legacy CD-ROM yet, but this doesn\u0027t mean it\u0027s not worth to invest into USB booting.   \n"
