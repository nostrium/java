Software protection is **always** easier to circumvent than hardware!  \n2.) Glue the switch shut to protect your USB -stick  \nor  \n3.)

So it is very adviced you use a backup utility to save this password, here is one i know Advanced EFS Data Recover (maybe a freeware one can be better), with this you can read files anywhere. (if you use ntfs enc feature, please mail yourself a backup of password code\\*\\*\\*\\*)  \n\nBut for this purpose (protect files from unwanted eyes) i advice truecrypt, which is free and more practical to use. ![:confused1:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/confused1.gif)   \n"
