      "content": "I have this sony vaio laptop, and the good people at sony decided not to give this drive the ability to boot from a usb device (external dvd or floppy)  \n\nUnfortunately the DVD drive that was built in BROKE, and I need to install windows on this laptop using a brand new hard drive.  \n\nAny ideas?  \n\nI can\u0027t boot from the windows dvd, I can\u0027t boot from a floppy, the drive is totally empty so I can\u0027t put anything on it.  \n\nI CAN however, connect it to another computer and format it, I thought I could make it into a MSDOS bootable drive (like when you format a floppy) but windows does not allow it on a drive this size.  \n\nIs there a program I can use to install the i386 files on this drive and make it bootable from a different computer?  \n\nHELP please!   \n"
