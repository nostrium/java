      "content": "Windows 7 is, as we know, the next version of Windows Vista. I tried its M1 build, and was told,   \nthere will be a beta release available in the Nov. of this year.  \n\nThis boot logo in this version, is something like the resuming logo of Vista or above, but it is  \nmore beautiful, i think. These images are all 24bits, the background image is 1024x768.  \n\nFor the OSLoad.exe, it is very simple, change the resolution and preivew it. And when you want to  \nquit, press the ESC key. ![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif)  \n\n\\[[download](http://aerostudio.boot-land.net/files/Win7_Load.rar \"External link\")\\]  \n\n![Posted Image](http://aerostudio.boot-land.net/files/snap.jpg)   \n"
