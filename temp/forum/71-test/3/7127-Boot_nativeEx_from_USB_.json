Thanks in advance\nHi mANZOCRICH, welcome ![:poke:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/poke.gif)   \n\nFor the 00000007B error, use the modified ntdetect [here](http://www.msfn.org/board/index.php?showtopic\u003d112630\u0026pid\u003d738009\u0026mode\u003dthreaded\u0026start\u003d#entry738009 \"External link\") and explained in detail in tutorial [here](http://www.boot-land.net/forums/?showtopic\u003d4111 \"External link\") under More Advanced Options section. The USB speed is determined by your hardware, as long as you use a 2.0 UFD/USB device and your host machine supports 2.0 you should be fine. Wireless is more complicated; focus on mastering the first two steps with NIC support and *wired* connectivity for now ![:poke:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/poke.gif)   \n"

Manzo\nThe TP-LINK is just an adapter so you won\u0027t want to install LiveXP on that ![:poke:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/poke.gif) - wireless in LiveXP is experimental at best and I\u0027m not sure it\u0027s even possible yet based on posts like [this one](http://www.boot-land.net/forums/index.php?showtopic\u003d6582 \"External link\"). You can read more about it [here](http://www.boot-land.net/forums/index.php?showtopic\u003d7036 \"External link\") and decide if it\u0027s something you want to try; just saw Galapo\u0027s post on PEDialup (get it [here](http://livexp.boot-land.net/ \"External link\")), looks interesting, I haven\u0027t tried it yet myself but let us know if you have success ![:poke:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/poke.gif)   \n"
