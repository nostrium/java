      "content": "Basically code in the BIOS \"scans\" the supported BUS(es) typically the PCI one and the ~~IDE~~ ATA and SATA interfaces.  \nThen it sends a request to the drive firmware which \"identifies\" itself as either:  \n\n* a removable disk (oldish \"Iomega\" ZIP disks)\n* a fixed disk (HD)\n* an optical device (CD/DVD)\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nSame happens for USB hub and devices connected to it.  \n\nLater, while DOS uses the informations given by BIOS as they are, Linux and NT based systems re-scan the system in order to find out what devices are connected (to load needed drivers), in a very similar way.  \n\nThere is no point into changing a HD into CD or viceversa, they support different commands and even different filesystems. ![:poke:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/poke.gif)   \n\nCould you detail what the actual question is? ![:poke:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/poke.gif)  \n\nI mean what would be the intended use of the change?  \n\nYou can *theoretically* change either the firmware on the drive or the BIOS and the drivers, really a very big **IF** .... ![:poke:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/poke.gif)  \n\nOr you can use a \"Filter Driver\" on NT based systems to \"trap\" the info and change it....  \n\nFor the record some USB stick controllers can be set as to work as \"dual devices\", typically the U3 ones, but also a number of other ones, just FYI:  \n[http://www.msfn.org/...howtopic\u003d121502](http://www.msfn.org/board/index.php?showtopic\u003d121502 \"External link\")  \n[http://www.msfn.org/...howtopic\u003d125138](http://www.msfn.org/board/index.php?showtopic\u003d125138 \"External link\")  \n\njaclaz   \n"
