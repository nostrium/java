I would like to create more then 1 partition on USB and windows recognise only 1 partition (assigne a drive letter for one partition). Crating partitions was OK but assigne drive letter for these partitions wasnt. .. I tryied lexer BootIt for remove for Flip the Removable Media Bit and not working. I tryed WinSetupFromUSb to fix and not working. I also used MPTool (UdTool) but it didnt recognise my USB stick .   \n\nso Is simple way to turn removable USB to non-removable USB (fixed USB)?  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nThanks a lot ![:poke:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/poke.gif)   \n"
