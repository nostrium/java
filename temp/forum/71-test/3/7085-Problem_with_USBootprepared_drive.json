      "content": "I susccessfully used the USBoot program to place a full, bootable copy of XP-SP3 installation on my USB-HDD.  \n\nIt booted successfully to these machines in this order:  \n1. Generic PC with ASUS P4P800 mobo--this is the machine it was created on.  \n2. Generic PC with Intel DG965RY mobo.  \n3. Dell Optiplex 755  \n4. HP/Compaq dc5800 slim desktop.  \n\nAt each bootup, I declined to allow the Found New Hardware wizard to install any drivers--though I have no idea what other changes got made silently by the OS.  \n\nI then took the drive back to the Intel machine and during bootup got the message that the ...system32\\\\config\\\\system file was missing or corrupted. I attempted no repairs.  \n\nI then booted with the same USB-HDD successfully to both the Dell and HP/Compaq.  \n\nI then returned to the Intel, and now the machine acts as if there is no OS at all. It still continues to boot OK to the Dell and Compaq.  \n\nHow can I best troubleshoot what has happened here? What is the best way to prevent this from happening again or at least minimize the chances?  \n\nMany thanks,  \nPeter.   \n"

(it won\u0027t be fast, you\u0027ll need to take your time)  \n\njaclaz   \n"

      "content": "Thanks,  \n\nI\u0027ll get the exact text of the message tomorrow, but it is to the effect that there is no system disk, insert disk with correct media. The drive has a multiple-choice boot.ini file on the USBoot drive and I don\u0027t get to see that menu on the machine where it won\u0027t boot.   \n\nI repeated the test today with a fresh installation of USBoot but in a different order. 1. ASUS--booted OK 2. Intel--booted OK 3. HP/Compaq--booted OK 4. Intel--NO BOOT 5. Dell--booted OK. 6. HP/Compaq--booted OK. 7. ASUS--booted OK.  \n\nI conclude the HP is doing something the Intel mobo doesn\u0027t like. So that might make it easier to track down.   \n\nThanks for the lead on ERUNT, I\u0027ll give it a try. Have you ever used a program called RegistryTracker that takes registry snapshots and can analyze the differences between them? I might give that a try also.  \n\nPeter.   \n"

      "content": "thasan:  \n\nI\u0027ve gotten several USB sticks to boot BartPE on the Intel including a MicroCenter generic 16Gb; a SanCruzer Micro 2.0 Gb, and a Transcend Jet Flash 2.0 Gb.  \n\nRe my USB-HDD, even though the drive fails to boot on the Intel after having gone to the HP, it continues to boot fine to the other machines. I\u0027m puzzled by what\u0027s going on since the Intel is refusing to boot the drive way before it gets to reading the registry, so it\u0027s getting hard for me to see how any registry changes could be causing this. But I haven\u0027t had time to try Jaclaz\u0027 advice to record registry changes as the drive boots to each machine.   \n"

      "content": "Well, I think its something else. I found working with number of machines, some of the boot sectors do not work on all. Seems like the hard drive is formatted correctly but your Intel machine has a different expectation than what\u0027s on the hard drive.  \n\nIn this case, two things have worked for me.   \n\n1) Boot with a VistaPE CD/USB and recreate the hard drive with DISKPART/Clean. Have to remember to rename NTLDR to BOOTMGR after (works 99% of the time)  \n2) The Intel machine has a emulation problem; i.e. it expects a USB floppy emulation not USB hard drive emulation. This behaviour I have experienced on various Dell servers. If this is the case, you will have to enter the bios with the USB HD plugged in, and then change the emulation type to HD.  \n\nIf all fails, jaclaz\u0027s solution is always there.   \n"
