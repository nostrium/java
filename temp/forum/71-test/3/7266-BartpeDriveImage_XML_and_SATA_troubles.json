      "content": "I have hear that this is the best place for troubleshooting problems, lets see it I am not misinformed.  \n\nNow my trouble is trying to get Driveimage XML to operate on a SATA drive through BART PE.  \n\nAt first i was being bombarded with BSODs thich I think told me that Bart PE could not find my hard drive. So as per instructions I downloaded the Driver pack from the sugested website and now bart pe starts, so i am getting somewhere. Now I am be told about a write error with info along the lines of unable to copy partition. At This point i am trying to store the partition image on an external drive and copy it to the system drive using drive to drive , i can\u0027t see this working but no harm in trying.  \n\nAny help would be great, as it appears that all the other forums have left me out to dry.  \n\nThanks   \n"
