      "content": "I\u0027ve created a USB boot drive, which I want to use on several computers. The weird thing is that it is being assigned a different drive letter on different computers! For example, the USB drive is assigned the letter A: on my AMD Athlon XP computer, and the letter C: on the Intel Core Duo. This is a problem because I can\u0027t have a unified CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files for both systems.  \n\nThe drive was created using HP USB Disk Storage Format Tool, with a Windows 98 boot system.  \n\nAny ideas how to resolve this?   \n"
