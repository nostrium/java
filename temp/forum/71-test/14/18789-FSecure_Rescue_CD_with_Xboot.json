After dropping the f-secure iso into xboot, i select the existing entry antivirus - f-secure rescue cd. after finishing and loading the new image, fsecure can be selected in the bootmenu, is starting to load until it say \"Welcome to F-Secure.... please make sure that you have acces to the internet...\" then it stops. Normally it should go on loading and showing \"oooo\" What\u0027s going wrong? Thanks for your help.\n\n"

      "content": "It is possible that the actual version of F-Secure you are using needs some \"different\" settings from the version that was tested in XBOOT (IF it was ever tested in it).\n\nThere is nothing you can do (and noone else can) in XBOOT as - due to a very sad incident - XBOOT is abandoned/not further developed:\n\n[http://reboot.pro/to...riam-of-shamur/](http://reboot.pro/topic/18247-in-memoriam-of-shamur/ \"\")\n\nYou could still go to the \"root\" of it, and check the Syslinux/isolinux (or grub4dos) provisions to boot F-Secure that XBOOT created and change/update those.\n\nXBOOT essentially is a \"wrap around\" to underlying boot managers/OS loaders, if you prefer it is a \"wizard\" making their use easier.\n\nOr you may want to try another tool to the same effect.\n\n![:cheers:](https://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif)\n\nWonko\n\n"
