      "content": "Hi  \n\nWhat are the diagnostic tools you regularly use ?. None of the DOS based boot disks like**Memtest86+ , Seagate Seatools** etc won\u0027t boot from **UEFI** if legacy support is disabled. Currently i use Win8x64 based boot disk which can boot fine on both legacy BIOS and**UEFI/Secureboot** . From the PE, i can run**HDtunePro , Passmark Diskcheckup** etc to test the hard drive.\n\n"
