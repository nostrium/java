So it cannot be booted from an ISO. ![:whistling:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/happy22.gif)\n\nEven if you extract the files, it won\u0027t boot because the BCD has been set to boot from the UUID of the \u0027CD\u0027.\n\nHere is how to get a flat boot working.\n\n1. Extact the whole ISO to the root of the E2B drive\n\n2. Run EasyBCD - File - Select BCD Store - (select e2B \\\\boot\\\\bcd file)\n\nand **Add New Entry** for Portable/External Media\n\nType: Extracted FilesSystem\n\nName: ESA Rescue\n\nDrive: (drive letter of e2B drive)\n\nEMS Enabled (unticked)\n\n-\\\u003e\\\u003e Add Entry\n\n3.

Make a new .mnu file\n\n```\ntitle ESA Rescue (Flat File) \\n Boots directly from files on drive\nchainloader /bootmgr\n```\n\nHTH\n\nSteve\n\nP.S. Under Advanced Menu, change the drive letter to BOOT so it can boot on other systems.\n\nP.P.S. Although this boots fine under a VM (with the USB drive as HDD0), I get 7B crash on real systems. Even running bcdboot to add a WinPE entry to the BCD does not work!\n\n**Edited by steve6375, 04 October 2013 - 03:06 PM.**\n"

      "content": "You can re-build the ISO as a WinPE boot.wim file\n\n1. Find a bootable WinPE ISO or project that has a \\\\sources\\\\boot.wim file. We need to copy the whole \\\\boot folder from this. We need the BCD file (for WinPE ram booting) and boot.sdi file (and maybe the font files).\n\n2. Extract the SysRescue ISO files to an empty folder (say SR) using 7Zip\n\n3. Delete the contents of the SR\\\\BOOT folder and delete the \\[BOOT\\] folder if present. Make a boot.wim file using imageX as follows\n\nimagex /boot /capture C:\\\\SR C:\\\\temp\\\\boot.wim \"My new wim file\"\n\ncopy the boot.wim file to C:\\\\SR\\\\SOURCES\\\\boot.wim\n\n4. Copy the contents of the WinPE BOOT folder found in Step 1 to the SR folder (SR\\\\BOOT\\\\BCD and SR\\\\BOOT\\\\boot.sdi should now be present)\n\n5. Make sure you have the bootmgr file in the SR folder\n\n\\\\bootmgr\n\n\\\\boot\\\\bcd\n\n\\\\boot\\\\boot.sdi\n\n\\\\boot\\\\font folder\n\n\\\\sources\\\\boot.wim\n\nAt this point you could use oscdimg to make a bootable ISO, however I used my tools and a spare USB drive as follows.\n\n1. Use RMPrepUSB to format a WinPE/BOOTMGR bootable FAT32 USB flash drive\n\n2. Copy the contents of the SR folder to the root of the flash drive\n\n~~3. Install grub4dos to the MBR and grldr~~\n\n~~4. Make a \\\\menu.lst file with~~\n\n```\nchainloader /bootmgr\n```\n\n~~in it~~\n\n~~5. Use **RMPrepUSB - F11** to boot it to QEMU and make sure it boots correctly (or boot it on a real system or VBox)~~\n\n~~6. Use the **RMPrepUSB - File - Make grub4dos ISO from Drive (Ctrl+M)** to make a bootable ISO file~~\n\nOf course, the ISO will need at least 512MB+ of memory to boot in, whereas the old flat-file ISO would not have needed anywhere near as much (which is presumably why it was made like this - they needed the flat file structure for low-RAM systems).\n\nP.S. When using ImageX in Step 3 - make sure you specify /boot - this is most important!\n\nNote: Step 6 does not make a bootable winpe ISO. Instead, omit steps 3-6 and instead use the command\n\noscdimg -n -m -o -bh:\\\\boot\\\\etfsboot.com h:\\\\ z:\\\\temp\\\\eva.iso\n\nto make the ISO\n\nNote that H:\\\\boot\\\\etfsboot.com does not need to be on your USB stick, it can be anywhere.\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n**Edited by steve6375, 05 October 2013 - 03:18 PM.**\n"
