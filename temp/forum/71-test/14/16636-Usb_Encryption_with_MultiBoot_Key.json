Or is there some type of hardware trick? Like to create 2 partitions on the Flash Drive 1 partition being the Bootable Disks and the other for Encryption?   \n"

This has been an unofficial way of getting stuff into work as my tight manager has refused to purchase the *official* encrypted USB sticks that are allowed on the system.  \n\nAs of last week it\u0027s no longer an option for me as I no longer have the account privileges needed to mount the image file I\u0027ve encrypted. It does however work well if you have the necessary account privileges.  \n\nRegards,  \n\nMisty   \n"
