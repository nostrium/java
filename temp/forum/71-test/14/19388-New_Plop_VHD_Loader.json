      "content": "In my recollection, \"**VHD** \" wasn\u0027t in common vocabulary around these parts until **Microsoft** allowed you to boot from them. It\u0027s too bad that most people started using it to mean a sector-by-sector disk image, instead of the actual fancier file-format which Microsoft allowed. ![:wheelchair:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/wheelchair.gif)  \n\nBut anyway, the product discussed in this thread is actually using the fancier thing, which I think is worth mentioning. Otherwise, **GRUB4DOS** can already do the sector-by-sector disk image, as we all know. :smile:  \n\nI might add that my **WvBootDD** project (an **NTLDR NtBootDD** \"driver\") was actually started with this goal in mind but only for **Windows** , so this **PLoP** product is definitely cool!   \n"
