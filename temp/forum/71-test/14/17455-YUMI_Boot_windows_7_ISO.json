When firadisk loads it sees the memory command **find:/multiboot/ISOs/win8.x64.915440.EI.I** and so loads the ISO (searches all media until it finds it and then loads it as a virtual DVD).  \nSo When each ISO boots, somehow you have to get it to run firadisk???  \nDid you test your method fully?   \n"

Changed it to 27 and that didn\u0027t seem to make a difference either way.

The 400gig shows up fine but not partition 1(grub4dos partition). I did unplug it and replugged it back in and it did not show that partition. Did not try Windows Disk Manager. I tried to load Win7 and got the error, Win7x32 Install wim could not be found. Tried to load Vista and same error from the grub4dos partition with number set on 17. Once I set it back to 07 or 27, Win7 install and Vista install.wim was located fine for install and Windows showed it back up. Disk Doctor would not show up the partition til I use the unhide partition option in BootIce. I will reset it to 17 and see if Windows Disk Manager shows it, if it would help you?  \n\nJust got your message so this will not work as that USB partition is required for Win7 installs?   \n"

I do use Yumi but not in this case and I am using tutorial 47 I believe, when you copy mysetup.cmd, winpeshl.ini, startnet.cmd to the mounted boot.wim and change the wim to say boot2.wim. Yes would like a separate post on this matter. I actually may have done something wrong as far as the Disk Doctor not showing the whole drive. I guess when mysetup.cmd runs to find wim, it can\u0027t because the partition is hidden. When I go back to 07 instead of 17, mysetup.cmd runs and finds wim on the USB partition fine.   \n"
