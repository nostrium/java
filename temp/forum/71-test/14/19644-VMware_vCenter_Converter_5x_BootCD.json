      "content": "Hello.\n\nIt\u0027s been some time since I last used winbuilder and all the other tools referenced here in the forum.\n\nBut I am facing a difficult task and I remembered reboot.pro could have the solution to my problem.\n\nVMware used to have a BootCD for their vCenter Converter tool but unfortunately it was discontinued since version 4.3 (current is v5.x).\n\nI know that vCenter Converter Standalone can be installed on the any system that I wish to convert to virtual but somehow our credentials don\u0027t allow us to install software on this particular server (not even Windows updates).\n\nWorse than that, we\u0027ve been told that if we find a way to install anything on this server we will void the maintenance contract. Accounting software server. We reeeeally don\u0027t want to mess with our accounting software.\n\nSo we checked with them and they don\u0027t see any problem in converting the system to virtual.\n\nSo our only hope is to build a BootCD with network support that could run vCenter Converter 5.x.\n\nDoes anyone know how we could do that?\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nCheers\n\n"

Indeed, when the VM is booted on the hypervisor it will immediately start uninstalling old drivers and ask for new drivers.  \nThat has almost the same impact (not to say a whole lot more impact!) than installing a small vCenter agent that has been tested by hundreds of thousands of companies for over the last 5 years.  \nI will keep that in mind but to make it more clear, we didn\u0027t simply install vCenter agent because those guys from the accounting software are pussies and said they would drop support on us.  \nAnd they have agreed to support the product in a VM. So I honestly don\u0027t care as long as we can make the conversion and that it works properly.  \n\n\u003e Maybe give us more background on what server it is, etc.\nSure. The old server is a Windows 2003 Standard (before R2).  \nIt has 2 PSU units but 1 of them has failed and since it is a \"white label\" hardware we can\u0027t find spares.  \nSo we really need to either migrate the OS and software to a new hardware or convert it to virtual and add it to our VMware cluster.  \nNow, the software is very old and was discontinued. At the proper time we didn\u0027t opt to migrate to a new platform. Now we have a system whose hardware can suddenly become a huge paper-weight and whose software is stopped in time back in 2005.  \nWe are already working (\\~ since 2 years ago) on a new accounting software and server but we need to keep old data available for historical and legal reasons for another \\~ 6 years. :?  \n\n\u003e Couldn\u0027t you create the Virtual server, and give it a pretty big (empty) disk, and then use cloning SW (think GHOST or other more modern equivelents) to copy the disk image over to the virtual disk?\nIn the past we\u0027ve tried doing that on a couple of occasions and it didn\u0027t work out for us.  \nLots of errors and lots of red crosses in device manager after the VM booted.  \nThat has never happened with any of the P2V conversions that we\u0027ve done using vCenter Converter.  \n\n\u003e You can try PWBoot.\nThanks for the hint, TheHive.  \nI will surely take a good look at PWBoot. Hope it allows me to install software.  \n\nThanks to both for your replies.  \nCheers   \n"

I\u0027m guessing that the vCenter tool does a lot of that for you, but no matter what, the basics of the underlying HW (real to emulated) will change somewhat...\n\nhere is link to article on it ...[http://www.serverwat...-line-mode.html](http://www.serverwatch.com/server-tutorials/disk2vhd-tool-using-command-line-mode.html \"External link\") I am guessing best approach might be to use some other bootable OS image to \"clone\" the disk onto a separate hard-drive, then play with that one - i.e. attach that cloned drive to another computer to run the disk2vhd conversion, then see if you can boot that drive...\n\nKeep us posted.\n\n"
