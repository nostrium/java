Is it possible to trick BIOS so it will see my USB-HDD as USB FDD and chainloader to primary OS? If so how can I do so? Step by step please :smile:  \n\u003e 2. Or should I use or...is there any PATA-\\\u003eUSB connector and connect my USB-HDD directly to mainboard? Will it be possible?  \n\u003e\n\u003e thanks in advanced for boot masters in here ![:hi:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/hi.gif)\ni boot with BartPE\u0027s LiveCD and it detect my USB Pen Drive (2GB) and when i run RMPrepUSB my USB Pen Drive status is \\*unmounted\\* ![:hi:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/hi.gif)   \n"
