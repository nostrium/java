You can simply load the ISO and make use of QEMU\u0027s virtualizing capabilities to emulate a system and check if the loaded file is ready to be written on disc.  \n\n**NOTE:** It is for quickly testing boot-loaders for USB drives or small image files with low resource requirements . It wasn\u0027t developed to be a full virtualization environment\n\n**What is new:**\n\n1· Drag and drop error -- Fixed  \n2· Minor interface changes  \n3· Improvement of codes\n\n[http://www.sordum.or...ur-image-files/](http://www.sordum.org/7763/qemu-simple-boot-v1-2-easily-test-your-image-files/ \"External link\")\n\n"

Very easy to use gui front end to test bootable iso\u0027s in Quemu emulator.\n\nOnly thing i see it might need also is a way to create a harddrive.\n\nThank you.\n\n"
