      "content": "Hi Folks,\n\nMy usb flash drive is causing post to take minutes to progress, and then the drive is not present when the boot device selection list finally shows up (F12 prompt).\n\nNot sure if this is related to Syslinux so I posted in the general usb forum. I have a corsair survivor 16gb usb 3 flash drive which I\u0027ve formatted as ntfs and trying to get booting to the YUMI menu using syslinux 5.01. The problem is only happening when I have the drive plugged into the usb 3 port. When I change the port behavior in the bios to only function as usb 2, the problem persists. When I plug the drive into the other usb port which is usb 2 only, it works fine. The system is a lenovo x1 carbon ultrabook.\n\nI\u0027ve configured the flash drive as such using win 7:\n\n1) Run diskpart,\n\n- sel disk 2\n\n- clean\n\n- create part pri\n\n- sel part 1\n\n- format fs\u003dntfs quick ;I need ntfs rather than fat32 because I have some .wim files which are 4gb+\n\n- active\n\n- assign letter\u003dE\n\n- exit\n\n2) I robocopy the yumi files and my other boot images over to the key\n\n3) I run syslinux 5.01 on the key: syslinux64.exe -d \\\\multiboot\\\\ -i E:\n\n4) I also tried running syslinux with some different switches: syslinux64.exe -m -s -d \\\\multiboot\\\\ -i E:\n\nAlso I\u0027m able to boot to winpe 3 from the usb 3 port when using a usb hdd (haven\u0027t tried yumi with syslinux with that hdd).\n\nIs this likely an incompatibility between syslinux and the usb 3 port in this laptop? I checked the specs and it\u0027s an intel mobile qs77 express chipset which includes both usb 3 and 2 ports in the chipset.\n\nThanks!\n\n"

      "content": "I just updated the BIOS and the behaviour persists. So I looked again in the BIOS options for the usb ports, and for the usb 3 port it is defaulted to Auto. I had already tried forcing it to usb 2 and that didn\u0027t help. So now I tried forcing it to usb 3, and now it works! I guess when it was set to Auto it was acting as a usb 2 port and it was not playing nicely with my usb 3 flash drive. I don\u0027t know why it didn\u0027t work on auto or usb 2 mode, but oh well. Thanks!\n\n"
