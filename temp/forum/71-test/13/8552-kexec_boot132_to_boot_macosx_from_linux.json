      "content": "Hello, boot-land community!  \n\nI try to boot MacOS X from Linux on Apple Intel Mac. But currently with no results.  \n\nI try to use kexec + grub4dos + boot-132. Boot-132 iso was converted to some bootable hd image. Then i use the following command:  \n\n# kexec -l grub.exe --initrd\u003dboot-132.img --command-line\u003d\"--config-file\u003dmap (rd) (hd0); map --hook; chainloader (hd0)+1; rootnoverify (hd0)\"  \n# kexec -e  \n\nWhen boot-132 started, my keyboard stop working. And i can\u0027t type any commands (press enter for example to continue booting). In the net i find biosdev\u003dxx option for boot-132. With this option i can specify device for booting. I try to change biosdev option in various ways, but started from kexec boot-132 don\u0027t see any internal drives, only the virtual image (--initrd\u003dboot-132.img).  \n\nMay be grub.exe follow to incorrect boot-132 work? Can i boot boot-132 from kexec without using of grub.exe?  \n\nAnybody have any experience in booting MacOS X from Linux through kexec?  \n\nP.S. Sorry for my english.   \n"
