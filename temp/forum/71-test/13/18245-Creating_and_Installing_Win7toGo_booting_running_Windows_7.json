A bit slow, but it is still manageable,\n\nunless someone advise me on how to increase the responsive a bit.\n\nI found out that after installing a firewall software, that Windows OS\n\nresponsiveness deteriorates even further, even though,\n\n**Enable write caching** is turned on.\n\nMotherboard that I am using is a ASUS P5G41CMLX, this motherboard\n\nsupports booting up from USB 2.0 port.\n\nThe creating part and installation went well, without any problem.\n\nHowever, when I was trying to install drivers for my graphic card- Asus EN9500GT.\n\nI could not install it completely no matter what I do. (I even restart the whole process of\n\nbuilding a new Win7toGo usb 3.0 pen drive)\n\nAlso, I could not finished installing Adobe Reader into my newly created, Win7toGo usb 3.0 pen drive.\n\nPlease......see the screen captures below:\n\n![Cannot_install_Adobe_Reader_zps2539ac2d.](http://i1132.photobucket.com/albums/m577/liukuohao/Cannot_install_Adobe_Reader_zps2539ac2d.jpg)\n\n![Cannot_install_NVIDIA_Graphic_Drivers_v3](http://i1132.photobucket.com/albums/m577/liukuohao/Cannot_install_NVIDIA_Graphic_Drivers_v30142_zpsa4561086.jpg)\n\nHas anyone is experiencing this problem?\n\nYour feedback and advice is most appreciated!!!!\n\nThank you.\n\n"

The drivers actually work and allow me to boot off from UEFI bios\n\nmotherboard whose using Asmedia USB3.0 chipset.\n\nJust one question about running SSD through USB3.0 ports, would Windows 7 treat / see SSD same as normal\n\nhard disk, i.e windows 7 will creat \"pagefile.sys\" automatically, if I am making \"Win7toGo\" on a SSD?\n\nThank for your advice so far.

But first let\u0027s try clearing the possible causes of the issues you reported.\n\nIf your answer is YES, then I can assume all other forum user is also having some type of queer problem.\n\nEven though, diskmod filter was applied successfully- meaning the system is able to manage paging\n\non its own.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, I did tried on 2 different branded USB 3.0 pen drives, both are showing me the\n\nsame problem, it just couldn\u0027t finish installing the motherboard drivers. If I am installing Nvidia drivers\n\nwhich is about 200MB, I will get a missing file in the TEMP directory, shown to me on the windows desktop\n\nduring the installation.\n\n\u003e how fast, by comparison, the correspondet USB bus is. On good ol\u0027 USB 2.0 a USB hard disk \"topped\" at between 30 and 40 Mb/sec, whilst even fast USB sticks would be around HALF that speed. It is possible that the same happens with USB 3.0 and what you report are simply timing problems.\n\nI thought USB3.0 pen drive is supposed to be backward-compatible with USB 2.0 bus, isn\u0027t it?\n\nIf the answer is YES....\n\nThen, the speed of writing and reading should NOT be a problem, however, I would NOT get top speed\n\nin USB3.0 range, that is all, since the bus is still using USB 2.0 speed, right?\n\n\u003e Having a pagefile on a flash device (and having it managed by the system ![:w00t:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/w00t.gif)) is \"pure folly\" as I see it, you can run Windows alright (if you have enough RAM) and at the most - since a few programs do require the existence of pagefile, but this should NOT apply to your case - make a very small pagefile, manually set to fixed size.\n\nWhen you stated pure folly, you actually mean to discourage me from using USB pen drive for installing Windows 7 on it, right?\n\nActually, to comment on the RAM size of my PC, it has 4GB of DDR3 RAM, which I thought should be no problem in\n\nsupporting Windows 7.\n\n\u003e A simple e-sata disk (which is a \"normal\" SATA bus) is much more \"direct\" than any USB one (and still is hot-pluggable, though it doesn\u0027t apply to your case). For the record, DOM\u0027s (Disk on Module) devices: [http://en.wikipedia..../Disk_on_module](/Disk_on_module \"External link\") have been used traditionally on such \"embedded\" systems. DOM\u0027s use (at a dear price) \"better\" (if you prefer more \"stable\") memory chips than any USB stick you can normally find on the market. Get a SATA DOM (examples here): [http://www.memorydep...iskonmodule.asp]( \"External link\") or a SSD and be done with it. (but still a \"plain\" Windows 7 is one of the least suitable OS for your goal) These modules are made for that, they suffer not from vibrations/shocks, have a wider operating temperature range when compared to hard disks, on the other side they are terribly expensive and offer very little capacity when compared to any hard disk. If size (and power consumption) is not an issue, get a conventional hard disk, again SATA/e-sata will behave better than any USB solution.\n\nThanks for your suggestion about IDE DOMs and SATA DOMs\n\nI actually gone through a lot hard thinking of whether using SATA interface in my project\n\n(IDE interface- forget about, it is already phased out, most newer motherboards don\u0027t have it).\n\nI have set my goals that SATA interface will not be used for running Windows 7.\n\nI am saving all SATA interfaces for storing CCTV footage only nothing else, since\n\nthey are very limited on ITX / Micro ATX motherboards (usually 4 SATA ports available)\n\nThat is why, all along, I am sticking to USB solution. If things did not turn out good.\n\nI may have to abondon using USB 3.0 pen drive and switch to USB 3.0 hard disk\n\nwhich I think is small and portable for my project.\n\nMay be, I may have to read this Post from the famous forum user Karyonix:\n\n[http://reboot.pro/to...sk-by-karyonix/](http://reboot.pro/topic/9196-tutorial-boot-windows-7-from-usb-hard-disk-by-karyonix/ \"\")\n\nAppreciated if more forum users can give me some feedback about using\n\nthe Diskmod filter driver here!\n\nThank you.\n\n**Edited by liukuohao, 17 March 2013 - 03:32 AM.**\n"

For the record, DOM\u0027s (Disk on Module) devices: [http://en.wikipedia..../Disk_on_module](/Disk_on_module \"External link\") have been used traditionally on such \"embedded\" systems.

If size (and power consumption) is not an issue, get a conventional hard disk, again SATA/e-sata will behave better than any USB solution.\n\nThanks for your suggestion about IDE DOMs and SATA DOMs\n\nI actually gone through a lot hard thinking of whether using SATA interface in my project\n\n(IDE interface- forget about, it is already phased out, most newer motherboards don\u0027t have it).\n\nI have set my goals that SATA interface will not be used for running Windows 7.\n\nI am saving all SATA interfaces for storing CCTV footage only nothing else, since\n\nthey are very limited on ITX / Micro ATX motherboards (usually 4 SATA ports available)\n\nThat is why, all along, I am sticking to USB solution. If things did not turn out good.\n\nI may have to abondon using USB 3.0 pen drive and switch to USB 3.0 hard disk\n\nwhich I think is small and portable for my project.\n\nMay be, I may have to read this Post from the famous forum user Karyonix:\n\n[http://reboot.pro/to...sk-by-karyonix/](http://reboot.pro/topic/9196-tutorial-boot-windows-7-from-usb-hard-disk-by-karyonix/ \"\")\n\nAppreciated if more forum users can give me some feedback about using\n\nthe Diskmod filter driver here!\n\nThank you.\n\n**Edited by liukuohao, 17 March 2013 - 03:32 AM.**\n"

      "content": "Dear Wonko,\n\n\u003e No, there is something else in your case. The diskmod filter driver does work, or at least there were no reports of it having issues. Maybe you are having an issue in the proper installing of it, or maybe it has issue with the USB 3.0 nature of your pendrive\n\nThanks for giving continuous suggesstion and advice.\n\nI may or may not agree to you advice at some point due to my personal reason.\n\nI hope you can understand.\n\nAs much I would like Diskmod filter driver to work, I have put lots of lots hours of getting it to work.\n\nThe problem is getting it RIGHT and doing it CONSISTENTLY! That is I am not getting the same result on another PC.\n\nYou see there are many pitfalls that wasn\u0027t shown, and I have to find it 1 by 1 using \"Trial by Error\" method.\n\nTo the cut the whole story short and simple to understand.....\n\nI solved my weird problem finally. That is no more seeing the TEMP issue.\n\nHow? You may ask.....\n\n1) Install basic raid driver from installation CD manually (that is not using motherboard software installer, instead search the driver on the CD and install it using **.inf**file.\n\n2) Shutdown the PC.\n\n2) Find a spare SATA hard disk (I am assuming the PC has no SATA hard disk plugged previously)\n\n***Note1: If you have a spare SATA hard disk, this will be a life-saver for you, the system will be perform faster and you get faster***\n\n***response having connected on the motherboard, together with Win7toGo USB 3.0 pen drive is running.***\n\n***Note2: If you don\u0027t a spare SATA hard disk, a spare IDE hard disk also help a bit but the response is not as fast as SATA hard disk.***\n\n***Note3: If you don\u0027t have any spare hard disk lying round, then you going to have a hard....and....long time getting software to install. You need to prepare yourself to sit on the chair for about 3- 5 hours. The speed on your modern Quad PC will become like snail pace.***\n\n***Although the speed on your modern PC will improve once you have installed Diskmod filter driver, but it is only marginal effect. Trust me, you feel the improved speed when you have a spare SATA hard disk connected to the motherboard.***\n\n3) Boot up Windows 7 x64 on my little Win7toGo USB3.0 pen drive.\n\n4) Let Windows 7 discovered the newly connected SATA hard disk, Windows 7 may request you to reboot the system.\n\n5) Reboot the system, once you are on the Windows 7 desktop, go to Computer, at start, right click on Computer, and select\n\nShow on desktop.\n\nNext, right-click **Computer-Propteries-Advanced system settings-Advanced-Settings-Advanced-Change(under Virtual Memory)**\n\nYou should see 3 things here:\n\ni) Automatically manage paging file size for all drivers \u003d enabled\n\nii) C: Paging File Size \u003d **blank/empty**\n\niii) Z: Paging File Size \u003d **System managed** (Z denotes your SATA hard disk, it could be E, F, or G...etc...)\n\n**NOW, go and install diskmod filter driver (as shown on Karyonix post),**\n\n**if you have installed the diskmod filter driver properly....**\n\n**Then you should find C: Paging File Size \u003d System managed**\n\n**(C drive should be automatically manage paging by Windows 7)**\n\n**If not, then you have not applied the Commands mentioned by Karyonix in the post.**\n\n6) Next, DISABLE \u003d Automatically manage page file size for all drivers.\n\n7) Click on the Z drive, and then select \u003d **System managed size** , next press **\"Set\"** button, click **\"OK\"**\n\nThen, Windows 7 will let you know that you should restart the system.\n\n8) Restart the system for the settings to take immediate effect.\n\n9) Once you are in Windows 7, recheck it at \u003d Right-click **Computer-Propteries-Advanced system settings-Advanced-Settings-Advanced-Change(under Virtual Memory)** , you should able to see both C and Z drive have the settings of **++System managed++** and running.\n\n10) Once this is done, I can install the software Nvidia drivers as per normal, there is no more **TMP issue** ocurring.\n\nThank you.\n\n**Edited by liukuohao, 18 March 2013 - 10:49 AM.**\n"
