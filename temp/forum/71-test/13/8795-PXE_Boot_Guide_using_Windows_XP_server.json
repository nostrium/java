      "content": "Hi **diddy**   \n\nThanks for the guide.  \n\nI have been trying to PXE Boot WinPE 2.1 (bootfile pxeboot.n12) in [VirtualBox](http://www.virtualbox.org/manual/UserManual.html#id2513649 \"External link\") with little success - a \u0027Windows failed to start... \\\\Boot\\\\BCD... 0xc0000001\" screen.  \n\nResearching the matter, I came across a message by **Bubble** [here](http://www.deployvista.com/Default.aspx?tabid\u003d70\u0026EntryID\u003d27 \"External link\") relating to the problem with Boot Manager entry names, i. e. \"Ramdisk options\" for all entries.  \n\n\u003e The solution? Delete \u0027{ramdiskoptions}\u0027s description, something like:  \n\u003e\n\u003e \\\u003e Bcdedit /store /deletevalue {ramdiskoptions} description  \n\u003e\n\u003e And now, the boot entries have no description to inherit, and so display their own.\nI haven\u0027t tried it, so can\u0027t vouch for it - just stumbled across it and recalled the note in your guide.  \n\nAlso, I can\u0027t seem to locate your batch files in the downloadable version of the guide. In particular, I was wanting to look at your 4a_WinPE.cmd and 4b_WinPE.cmd. How do I find them?  \n\nRegards :smile:   \n"
