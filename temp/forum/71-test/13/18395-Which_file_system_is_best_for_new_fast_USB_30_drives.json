      "content": "Hey there,\n\nI am wondering which file system would be best, in terms of speed, for booting and running OS natively from new USB 3.0 flash drive. From what I underrstand, it is 4K read speed, that is most important(unless OS is stored as one big file) for running smoothness. I don\u0027t care about compatibility, as this is purely synthetic question. Wikipedia produces whole list of flash drive specific file systems:\n\n[http://en.wikipedia....sh_file_systems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_flash_file_systems \"External link\")\n\nThen we got those flash drives that reach 200MB/s read times(15MB/s for 4K), which is already better than non-SSD hard drives. The question is, how fast those are with files systems designed specially for them?\n\n"

Like \"Do not forget to zero the MBR first\" or \"it is faster than NTFS\"\n\nI\u0027m going to make some tests using this format, and I\u0027ll post my findings, first will be check if Grub4dos works on it.\n\nBest Regards\n\n**Edited by alacran, 04 April 2013 - 09:47 AM.**\n"
