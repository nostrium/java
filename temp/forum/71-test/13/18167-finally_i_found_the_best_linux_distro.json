PCLINUXOS\n   http://www.terasaur.org/torrent/download/4f9a7e3a7769f120d3924b05775d82a4a916c89e/pclinuxos-kde-fullmonty-2012.09.iso.torrent\n\nB.

F:\\\\_ISO\\\\linux (* *F is the drive letter of the flash drive)*\n\n7. copy the pclinuxos iso file(*pclinuxos-kde-fullmonty-2012.09.iso*) to the \"linux\" folder under \"_ISO\" folder.\n\n(*do not include other files, only the pclinuxos iso file)*\n\n8*.* go back to RMPREPUSB and press Ctrl+F2(*click and hold Ctrl and press F2)*to launch wincontig then click analyze to ensure that\n\nthe ISO file is **contiguous**.\n\n(*in my case, there no problems meaning, no fragmented files)*\n\n(*do not quit RMPREPUSB)*\n\n9. open the menu.lst using notepad or similar editor from you flash drive and paste the code below. save and close the editor.\n\n```\n# - 2B WITH PERSISTENCE - PARTITION TABLE ENTRY 4 MUST BE EMPTY --\n\n# FAT32 USB DRIVES ONLY - DOES NOT WORK ON NTFS USB DRIVES (livecd file not found)!\n\n#must enable parttype output\ndebug on\n# make empty table entry in 4th position in ptn table\nparttype (hd0,3) | set check\u003d\nset check\u003d%check:~-5,4% \u003e nul\nif \"%check%\"\u003d\u003d\"0x00\" partnew (hd0,3) 0 0 0 \u003e nul\nif not \"%check%\"\u003d\u003d\"0x00\" echo WARNING: PTN TABLE 4 IS ALREADY IN USE! \u0026\u0026 pause \u0026\u0026 configfile /menu.lst\n\niftitle [if exist (bd)/_ISO/linux/pclinuxos-kde-fullmonty-2012.09.iso] Boot pclinuxos-kde-fullmonty-2012.09.iso WITH PERSISTENCE\nmap (bd)/_ISO/linux/pclinuxos-kde-fullmonty-2012.09.iso (0xff)\nmap --hook\nroot (0xff) \u003e nul\n# set partition 4 of USB to be changes files which is formatted as ext2 filesystem\nif exist (bd)/changes partnew (hd0,3) 0x00 (bd)/changes \u0026\u0026 echo Partition 4 now points to /changes file!\nif not exist (bd)/changes echo WARNING: /changes file does not exist - SO NO PERSISTENCE! \u0026\u0026 pause\n# change splash\u003dsilent to splash\u003dverbose to see all messages\n#To run from RAM use the copy2ram cheatcode\nkernel /isolinux/vmlinuz fromusb bootfromiso\u003d/_ISO/linux/pclinuxos-kde-fullmonty-2012.09.iso livecd\u003dlivecd root\u003d/dev/rd/3 acpi\u003don vga\u003d788 keyb\u003den vmalloc\u003d256M  nokmsboot  splash\u003dverbose changes_dev\u003dLABEL\u003dchanges \u003e nul\ninitrd  /isolinux/initrd.gz \u003e nul\n```\n\n10. go back again to RMPREPUSB and select Create Ext2 FS to make the OS persistent. type \"changes\" for the filename(*do not*\n\n*type any filename, must be name \"changes\")* and choose a suitable size (e.g. 256MB, 480MB, 900MB or 1GB - avoid 500MB,\n\nthere seems to be a problem with this size as stated by steve6375.\n\n(*in my case, i allocated 2GB or 2000MB so i can install additional packages, etc.)*\n\n(*Wait until the file has been created successfully.*)\n\n11. so, there you have it a bootable persistent pclinuxos with many preinstalled programs, etc. now, you can test it. you just have\n\nto configure BIOS to boot first to flash drive(*refer to motherboard or laptop manual).*\n\n*thanks to steve6375 for this wonderful tutorial. he has many tutorials. just visit the site:* ++[http://www.rmprepusb.com/](http://www.rmprepusb.com/ \"External link\")++\n\nOutstanding!

      "content": "after days of searching for other linux os, i found out this portable pocket operating system: Slax Linux\n\naccording to the slax website, [http://www.slax.org/en](http://www.slax.org/en \"External link\")\n\n```\nSlax Linux your pocket operating system\n\nSlax is a modern, portable, small and fast Linux operating system with a modular approach and outstanding design. Despite its small size, Slax provides a wide collection of pre-installed software for daily use, including a well organized graphical user interface and useful recovery tools for system administrators.\n\nThe modular approach gives you the ability to include any other software in Slax easily. If you\u0027re missing your favourite text editor, networking tool or game, simply download a module with the software and copy it to Slax, no need to install, no need to configure.\n```\n\nyou can try the pocket os. here are the steps:\n\n1. download slax linux *(download for usb - english us 32 bit to be compatible to old computers)* by clicking the link below\n\n[http://ftp.linux.cz/...-7.0.5-i486.zip](http://ftp.linux.cz/pub/linux/slax/Slax-7.x/7.0.5/slax-English-US-7.0.5-i486.zip \"External link\")\n\n2. while downloading, prepare a 2GB or larger flash drive*(be sure to backup first important files).*\n\n3. format the flash drive using Windows*(right click the flash drive and select format)* or use the HP USB Disk Storage Format\n\nTool 2.2.3*(click the link below)*. select FAT32 and check quick format and click OK.\n\n[http://download1us.s...d/HPUSBDisk.exe](http://download1us.softpedia.com/dl/c0d9a2c4b6da1c892860375a27f41464/512416eb/100123786/software/hdd/HPUSBDisk.exe \"External link\")\n\n4. follow the simple tutorial from the slax website which can be found inside the downloaded archive, here it is:\n\n```\na) Extract the contents of ZIP archive to your USB drive.\n   If you are using Windows, you will get for example E:\\slax\\\n   You probably already did this, just make sure you extracted\n   the archive to your USB drive and not to your local harddisk.\n\nb) Now navigate to directory /slax/boot/ on your USB drive.\n   In Windows, it will be E:\\slax\\boot\\ for example.\n   Use explorer or any other file manager for this task.\n\nc) While you\u0027re in the boot directory, locate file bootinst.bat\n   Run it by doubleclicking it. It will setup your USB to boot.\n\n-- That\u0027s it. Your USB device is now ready to boot slax.\n-- You can safely delete this file (slax.txt), it\u0027s not needed.\n```\n\n5. you can carry it wherever you go to troubleshoot problems and malwares attacks.\n\n6. you can extend the capabilities of slax linux by installing its modules.\n\n[http://www.slax.org/en/modules.php](http://www.slax.org/en/modules.php \"External link\")\n\n7. just the explore the slax website.\n\nthanks to slax linux pocket os and its creators\n\n![:clap:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/clap.gif) ![:good:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/good.gif) ![:jump:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/jump.gif) ![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif)\n\n**Edited by moklo, 20 February 2013 - 12:35 AM.**\n"

PCLINUXOS\n   http://www.terasaur.org/torrent/download/4f9a7e3a7769f120d3924b05775d82a4a916c89e/pclinuxos-kde-fullmonty-2012.09.iso.torrent\n\nB.

F:\\\\_ISO\\\\linux (* *F is the drive letter of the flash drive)*\n\n7. copy the pclinuxos iso file(*pclinuxos-kde-fullmonty-2012.09.iso*) to the \"linux\" folder under \"_ISO\" folder.\n\n(*do not include other files, only the pclinuxos iso file)*\n\n8*.* go back to RMPREPUSB and press Ctrl+F2(*click and hold Ctrl and press F2)*to launch wincontig then click analyze to ensure that\n\nthe ISO file is **contiguous**.\n\n(*in my case, there no problems meaning, no fragmented files)*\n\n(*do not quit RMPREPUSB)*\n\n9. open the menu.lst using notepad or similar editor from you flash drive and paste the code below. save and close the editor.\n\n```\n# - 2B WITH PERSISTENCE - PARTITION TABLE ENTRY 4 MUST BE EMPTY --\n\n# FAT32 USB DRIVES ONLY - DOES NOT WORK ON NTFS USB DRIVES (livecd file not found)!\n\n#must enable parttype output\ndebug on\n# make empty table entry in 4th position in ptn table\nparttype (hd0,3) | set check\u003d\nset check\u003d%check:~-5,4% \u003e nul\nif \"%check%\"\u003d\u003d\"0x00\" partnew (hd0,3) 0 0 0 \u003e nul\nif not \"%check%\"\u003d\u003d\"0x00\" echo WARNING: PTN TABLE 4 IS ALREADY IN USE! \u0026\u0026 pause \u0026\u0026 configfile /menu.lst\n\niftitle [if exist (bd)/_ISO/linux/pclinuxos-kde-fullmonty-2012.09.iso] Boot pclinuxos-kde-fullmonty-2012.09.iso WITH PERSISTENCE\nmap (bd)/_ISO/linux/pclinuxos-kde-fullmonty-2012.09.iso (0xff)\nmap --hook\nroot (0xff) \u003e nul\n# set partition 4 of USB to be changes files which is formatted as ext2 filesystem\nif exist (bd)/changes partnew (hd0,3) 0x00 (bd)/changes \u0026\u0026 echo Partition 4 now points to /changes file!\nif not exist (bd)/changes echo WARNING: /changes file does not exist - SO NO PERSISTENCE! \u0026\u0026 pause\n# change splash\u003dsilent to splash\u003dverbose to see all messages\n#To run from RAM use the copy2ram cheatcode\nkernel /isolinux/vmlinuz fromusb bootfromiso\u003d/_ISO/linux/pclinuxos-kde-fullmonty-2012.09.iso livecd\u003dlivecd root\u003d/dev/rd/3 acpi\u003don vga\u003d788 keyb\u003den vmalloc\u003d256M  nokmsboot  splash\u003dverbose changes_dev\u003dLABEL\u003dchanges \u003e nul\ninitrd  /isolinux/initrd.gz \u003e nul\n```\n\n10. go back again to RMPREPUSB and select Create Ext2 FS to make the OS persistent. type \"changes\" for the filename(*do not*\n\n*type any filename, must be name \"changes\")* and choose a suitable size (e.g. 256MB, 480MB, 900MB or 1GB - avoid 500MB,\n\nthere seems to be a problem with this size as stated by steve6375.\n\n(*in my case, i allocated 2GB or 2000MB so i can install additional packages, etc.)*\n\n(*Wait until the file has been created successfully.*)\n\n11. so, there you have it a bootable persistent pclinuxos with many preinstalled programs, etc. now, you can test it. you just have\n\nto configure BIOS to boot first to flash drive(*refer to motherboard or laptop manual).*\n\n*thanks to steve6375 for this wonderful tutorial. he has many tutorials. just visit the site:* ++[http://www.rmprepusb.com/](http://www.rmprepusb.com/ \"External link\")++\n\nOutstanding!

Despite its small size, Slax provides a wide collection of pre-installed software for daily use, including a well organized graphical user interface and useful recovery tools for system administrators.\n\nThe modular approach gives you the ability to include any other software in Slax easily. If you\u0027re missing your favourite text editor, networking tool or game, simply download a module with the software and copy it to Slax, no need to install, no need to configure.\n```\n\nyou can try the pocket os. here are the steps:\n\n1. download slax linux *(download for usb - english us 32 bit to be compatible to old computers)* by clicking the link below\n\n[http://ftp.linux.cz/...-7.0.5-i486.zip](http://ftp.linux.cz/pub/linux/slax/Slax-7.x/7.0.5/slax-English-US-7.0.5-i486.zip \"External link\")\n\n2. while downloading, prepare a 2GB or larger flash drive*(be sure to backup first important files).*\n\n3. format the flash drive using Windows*(right click the flash drive and select format)* or use the HP USB Disk Storage Format\n\nTool 2.2.3*(click the link below)*. select FAT32 and check quick format and click OK.\n\n[http://download1us.s...d/HPUSBDisk.exe](http://download1us.softpedia.com/dl/c0d9a2c4b6da1c892860375a27f41464/512416eb/100123786/software/hdd/HPUSBDisk.exe \"External link\")\n\n4. follow the simple tutorial from the slax website which can be found inside the downloaded archive, here it is:\n\n```\na) Extract the contents of ZIP archive to your USB drive.\n   If you are using Windows, you will get for example E:\\slax\\\n   You probably already did this, just make sure you extracted\n   the archive to your USB drive and not to your local harddisk.\n\nb) Now navigate to directory /slax/boot/ on your USB drive.\n   In Windows, it will be E:\\slax\\boot\\ for example.\n   Use explorer or any other file manager for this task.\n\nc) While you\u0027re in the boot directory, locate file bootinst.bat\n   Run it by doubleclicking it. It will setup your USB to boot.\n\n-- That\u0027s it. Your USB device is now ready to boot slax.\n-- You can safely delete this file (slax.txt), it\u0027s not needed.\n```\n\n5. you can carry it wherever you go to troubleshoot problems and malwares attacks.\n\n6. you can extend the capabilities of slax linux by installing its modules.\n\n[http://www.slax.org/en/modules.php](http://www.slax.org/en/modules.php \"External link\")\n\n7. just the explore the slax website.\n\nthanks to slax linux pocket os and its creators\n\n![:clap:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/clap.gif) ![:good:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/good.gif) ![:jump:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/jump.gif) ![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif)\n\n**Edited by moklo, 20 February 2013 - 12:35 AM.**\n"

      "content": "after following my own tutorial on kaspersky, i knew that the virus database is not fully updated. i updated it. since kaspersky does not support wireless connection, i run it on computers that has wired connection. be sure the internet connection is fast for updates to finish early.\n\ni assume you already have you kaspersky flash drive following the tutorial above.\n\nhere\u0027s what to do:\n\n1. configure first your BIOS to boot to flash drive *(refer to your motherboard or laptop manual)*\n\n2. insert the kaspersky flash drive or the YUMI flash drive with kaspersky to the computer. *\\[ if you use kaspersky\u0027s rescue2usb then KRD will automatically be booted. if you use YUMI, you have to find KRD under \"Antivirus Tools\" then \"Kaspersky Rescue CD (Virus Scanner) to boot it. So, here in my case, I use YUMI. \\]*. Next, choose \"Run Kaspersky Rescue Disk from this USB\" and wait....\n\n3. \"Operating system\" prompt will appear *(that\u0027s my case because I have installed multiple operating systems in my hard drive, e.g. XP SP3 \\\u0026 various versions of Windows 7)* asking where to save the files to be used by KRD or under which Operating System the files will be put to *(i choose XP SP3)*. Be sure to remember where you save it. If you have only two local disks (e.g. C: and D:), then there is no problem. Dont worry, you can trace the KRD files on the root of either of the two local disks. The folder name is \"Kaspersky Rescue Disk 10.0\" or similar to that name. To be sure and safe and avoid confusions, delete all the previous \"Kaspersky Rescue Disk 10.0\" folders located on every root of the drive or rename those folders if you have put some files inside like executables, etc. Better check the contents of the folder first. I am not sure if the OS prompt will appear if you have only one operating system so discover it yourselves.\n\n4. click OK and the KRD will launch automatically. If not, open Kaspersky Rescue Disk located on the desktop. Choose \"My Update Center\" tab and click \"Start update\" to update it. Wait for it to finish. Possibly it takes 15-30 minutes depending on the connection speed. Update it again to be sure and check it.\n\n5. while the KRD updates itself, click on Settings, change the current security level to High by dragging the small button upward then select the button \"Select action\". Be sure \"disinfect\" and \"delete if disinfection fails\" check boxes are being checked. then click Apply. click on \"Settings\" button beside the \"Default level\" button and choose the \"Additional\" tab not the \"Additional\" button. Drag the small button to the right which points to \"deep scan\" then click \"OK\" and click \"Apply\".\n\n6. now, click \"Threats and exclusions\" and click \"Settings\" button. Be sure to check all the checkboxes. Do not leave any checkboxes unchecked. click \"OK\" and click \"Apply\".\n\n7. next, go to \"Reports and Storages\" and uncheck all the checkboxes and click \"OK\". That\u0027s it! You are ready to scan and remove all the malwares on all infected drives. Just wait for the update to finish before you start scanning. After scanning you can view the quarantine, report or just close KRD.\n\n8. to start scanning, choose the \"Objects Scan\" tab, check all the checkboxes or you can add specific location by clicking \"Add\" denoted by plus sign then click \"Start Objects Scan\" and wait for the scanner to scan and remove the malwares and infections.\n\n9. to save you time and money and prevent reupdating the KRD all the time after restart or shutdown or after booting to other desktops or laptops, you must copy the whole \"Kaspersky Rescue Disk 10.0\" folder to your flash drive *(if there is more space)* or to an external hard drive or portable hard drive. The folder can be found on the root of any of the local drive, just inspect every drive one by one. Since the file manager of KRD cannot detect the flash drive, we must use other ways.\n\n10. you can use LiveXP, WinPE, VistaPE, Win7PE, Win7PE_SE, Win8PE, or any linux distros(e.g. Parted Magic, Slax Linux) that has file managers or explorers that mounts and detects flash drives, hard drives, etc. *(in my case, i use Parted Magic)*. You can also use the minixp in Hiren\u0027s Boot CD. So, therefore, I recommend using YUMI so you can combine Kaspersky Rescue Disk, Parted Magic, Hiren\u0027s Boot CD, etc. on the same flash drive.\n\n11. I\u0027m already assuming that you insert your YUMI flash drive to another desktop or laptop computer to remove malware. Boot any of the suggested bootable portable operating systems (e.g. Parted Magic, Slax Linux, LiveXP, etc). To be sure, copy \"Kaspersky Rescue Disk 10.0\" folder from your flash drive or portable hard drive to the root of all local disks available. Overwrite \"Kaspersky Rescue Disk 10.0\" folder if it exists already there or if there is a prompt but be sure read it first. After copying, restart the computer.\n\n12. boot to Kaspersky Rescue Disk following step 2 up to step 8.\n\n13. to update the database and definitions, follow steps 9 and 10.\n\n14. to run KRD that is up to date on desktops and laptops that has no wired connections, follow steps 11 and 12.\n\nCONGRATULATIONS! There you have it, an up to date and updatable Kaspersky Rescue Disk. Thanks to YAHWEH for guiding me in writing and realizing these tutorials. Without HIS grace, these will be impossible. Thanks to Kaspersky, YUMI, and others not mentioned.\n\n![:yahoo:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/yahoo.gif) ![:jump:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/jump.gif) ![:thumbsup:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/thumbsup.gif) ![:happy_dance:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/celebrate14.gif) ![:smiling9:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/smiling9.gif) ![:happy_dance2:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/celebrate3.gif) ![:D](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/biggrin.png) ![:lol:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/laugh.png) :smile: ![:thumbup:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/thumbup.gif) ![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif) ![:clap:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/clap.gif)\n\n**Edited by moklo, 27 March 2013 - 10:42 AM.**\n"

Are there any recent ones?\n\nI saw that you found ArchBang otherwise I can provide Archpup iso for you.\n\nThe author of ArchPup has moved on to another project that is similar to ArchPup called AlphaOS\n\nCheck out\n\n[http://www.murga-lin...pic.php?t\u003d84870](http://www.murga-linux.com/puppy/viewtopic.php?t\u003d84870 \"External link\")\n\nand\n\n[http://alphaos.freeforums.org/](http://alphaos.freeforums.org/ \"External link\")\n\nand I guess for download\n\n[http://sourceforge.n...ojects/alphaos/](http://sourceforge.net/projects/alphaos/ \"External link\")\n\nI still use Archpup though\n\n"

      "content": "If you really want to try Puppy Linux, then I suggest one of their recent official 5.5 distros, prefferably Slacko 5.5 that is using some of Slackware 14.0 packages. IF you are into USB bootables, then I would also check any version based on 3.8 kernel that is supporting f2fs filesystem, which is designed specially for (some newer)flash drives.  \n\nAs for persistency on USB sticks, from what I know all mainline Puppies have it build it - simply just run for the first time, config and then restart. Upon every restart you wil be asked if you want to create persistent file and save settings. Beware that once you do, it will be used every time, unless you change boot parameter.  \n\nOverall Puppy Linux was designed as small, fast, hardware compatible \"out of box\" USB distribution, but i have found that it isn\u0027t really that compatible, lacks certain drivers and packages in package list(!), lots of features described as \"out of box\" does not work properly, and it might even slowdown or crash. Of course you can fix most of the problems if you spend enough time, but for me customizing it for every system kinda contradicts \u0027multiboot\u0027 approach.  \n\nNevertheless if you are into USB linux, and didn\u0027t try it, then you definitely should.   \n\n**Edited by popov, 02 April 2013 - 03:20 PM.**\n"

      "content": "I cannot say for AlphaOS since I had a problem with touchpad and no time to fix it at the moment so havent really tried it\n\nfor ArchPup steps would be\n\n1. Go to steves RMPrepUSB site and follow the tut 72 at [http://www.rmprepusb...asy-to-maintain](http://www.rmprepusb.com/tutorials/72---easyboot---a-grubdos-multiboot-drive-that-is-easy-to-maintain \"External link\")\n\nIt explains how to format USB drive and install Easy2Boot\n\n2. Drop ArchPup iso in **\\\\_Iso\\\\Linux\\\\Auto**folder, make sure it is contiguos with wincontig (this also explained in tut 72 afore mentioned) and then boot to USB drive and select Archpup in menu.\n\n3. When Archpup is booted to get persistence right click on desktop and choose system--\\\u003eMake personal savefile\n\n(Depending on what version of archpup you use you may be booted to a commandline, write \"archpupx\" here to start windowmanager, you may have to do it 2 or 3 times)\n\nyou probably should try AlphaOS though since Archpup is discontinued!\n\n@popov\n\nDid you try ArchPup or AlphaOS?\n\n**Edited by Scooby, 02 April 2013 - 06:10 PM.**\n"
