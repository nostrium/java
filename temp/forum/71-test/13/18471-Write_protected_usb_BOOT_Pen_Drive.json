      "content": "Easy2Boot requires the USb drive to be writeable.\n\nYou can protect a disk or volume from being written to by Windows if it is NTFS partition by using DiskPart and setting to Read-Only - but this is ignored by linux/dos/pre-Vista OS\u0027s.\n\nIf your end users will mostly be using Windows, then you could put your boot files on the flash drive 2nd partition - this is normally not accessible under Windows and so users will not be able to delete files. However they can still format the pen drive or access the ptn using a different OS. Easy2Boot will not work however if on the 2nd partition.\n\nIf you have a pen drive that has a suitable utility, you can make a CD partition on it or a write-protected partition as described in the article - however be warned that you are likely to trash your USB pen !\n\n"
