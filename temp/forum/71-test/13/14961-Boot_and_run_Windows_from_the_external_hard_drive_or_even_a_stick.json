      "content": "Hello,  \n\nI looked on the web too, made many trials and tests, but still did not get what I need. I also read a lot in this forum, but each did get more confused.  \n\nMy notebook no longer works to connect the internal hard drive, because it has some defect in the connector. I took workshops for repair, but it was not worth fixing, it would have to replace the motherboard.  \nI tried to connect the external USB hard drive and of course did not start in Windows.  \nI install Linux to use a provisional to find a better solution.  \nPreviously, the laptop works fine with Windows XP, but also may work with Windows 7.  \nWhat I do is to boot Windows and run the external hard drive or even a stick.  \nI researched a lot on the web and could not get a good solution and would appreciate a suggestion to resolve this situation.  \n\nI want an external harddrive boot this laptop, just that, ie, load Windows and I was able to use as an internal harddrive. The external harddrive may be new.  \n\nThanks   \n"

      "content": "There is NO error such as \"out of NTLDR\".  \nPost the EXACT text of the error. (even if in brazilian/portuguese)  \nIt is likely that it is a \"missing NTLDR\" kind of error (which you see as white txt on black background) which usually is related to a problem with the bootsector (typically \"wrong CHS geometry\").  \nIf the notebook is a Lenovo this is \"typical\" (but other brands/models may have the same kind of issue).  \nBasically the BIOS maps the disk (when internally connected) as having a geometry of 240 heads, whilst once the same disk is inside an USB encliosure it maps the disk as having the \"normal\" 255 heads.  \nYou can remove the CHS check in the bootsector, see here:  \n\u003chttp://reboot.pro/8528/page__st__21\u003e  \nBut it is possible that you also need to correct data in the partition table in the MBR (and the given thread on 911CD also contains related info to this).  \n\n![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif)  \nWonko   \n"
