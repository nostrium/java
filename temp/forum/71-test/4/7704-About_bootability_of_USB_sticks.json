(bold is mine)  \n\nIn my opinion it is not really so, and then I disagree.  \nI assume that you refer to HP USB Disk Storage Format Tool when you say \"a special tool\".  \nSo if you take a look here [http://www.boot-land...?...ost\\\u0026p\u003d14607](http://www.boot-land.net/forums/index.php?showtopic\u003d2246\u0026view\u003dfindpost\u0026p\u003d14607 \"External link\") you can discover the real reason (at least that we know until now) that make your UFD formatted by HP Format Tool *quite* bootable, but in my experience then it does not mean that the BIOS will see it as a Hard Disk: **if** your UFD (formatted by HP Format Tool) will boot, then it boots for the reason described in the above linked post and not because the BIOS sees it as a Hard Disk.  \n\nIf you really want that your UFD is seen by the BIOS as a Hard Disk (reaching a real better bootability) then you have to partitioning your UFD with (at least) 2 partitions just as described here [http://www.boot-land...?...ost\\\u0026p\u003d63162](http://www.boot-land.net/forums/index.php?s\u003d\u0026showtopic\u003d7512\u0026view\u003dfindpost\u0026p\u003d63162 \"External link\")  \n\nThis way (that\u0027s my linked tutorial) assures that the BIOS will really see your UFD as a Hard Disk reaching a high hardware compatibility UFD/BIOSes (please, read: a high bootability) and then your UFD will boot (reasonably) from the most machines out there, and so from more machines rather than when it is formatted by HP Format Tool. :smile:   \n"

      "content": "@jaclaz  \n\nPlease, let me specify/explain/confront some my \"conception\" points just related to your posted ones.  \n\n\u003e 1) If first sector of the device contains a partition table, and the partition table contains a single valid entry, Windows will see it as a HD-like device. (please note that it is not necessary to have bootable MBR CODE in first sector, ONLY one valid partition entry and the magic bytes 55AA at the end of sector)\nReally, since the already mentioned procedure in order to increase my UFDs bootability is reliably working for me then I\u0027ve not been more interested in HD-like feature/behaviour of my UFDs under Windows provided by HP Format Tool, because I\u0027ve been more interested in my UFDs behaviour booting-BIOSes-related, and then in a better and wider compatibility about the best (that\u0027s also the simpler and the less tweaked possible) way for me in order to reach this goal.  \nMy experienced results about the initial and *una tantum* partitioning of my UFDs with XP\u0027s Disk Management (\\\u003e \"Format-it-\\\u0026-Forget-it\" way) have been very effective for me and then until now I have been able to boot my UFDs on every machine I\u0027ve tried, but not the same thing occurs with HP Format Tool and/or with a MBR created in a different way.  \nAnd yes, the MBR of my UFDs created with the above mentioned way (\"Format-it-\\\u0026-Forget-it\") just contains the \"magic 55 AA bytes\" at the end of the sector. :smile:   \n\n```\n00 00 00 00 00 2C 44 63 6D C3 43 B9 00 00 80 01\n\n01 00 06 FE FF CF 3F 00 00 00 91 3F EF 00 00 00\n\n00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n\n00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n\n00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 55 AA\n```\n\nFurthermore performing my some tests about MBR I\u0027ve noticed that replacing the MBR of my UFD is a practice working related to the partitioning and it is unfortunely NOT working about the pure booting.

(you cannot define me as an \"expert\" and right after ignore my experience on the specific field, or, to be more exact, you ***can*** ![:(](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/sad.png), but it\u0027s not nice :smile:: do make up your mind, you either trust me and try to follow my suggestions or you decide that I am a crazy nut that posts random things in order to undermine your findings)\n* The reason why that particular machine boots if there are two partitions is **unknown** :smile:, but ***in my opinion*** it is to be found in it\u0027s BIOS.\n* It\u0027s ***your*** idea, ***your*** finding, ***your*** everything, noone is going to deprive ***you*** of the paternity of the observation. :smile:\n* Due to point #2 above, it is***my opinion*** that having two or more partitions is not a \"general\" requisite for USB bootability, meaning that it will increase the bootability of the stick only in a very small number of cases, at the moment we totaled 1 (one) such report\n* Since it doesn\u0027t make ANY harm, expecially because if the stick is partitioned with a \"balanced\" CHS and LBA you will have anyway some spare sectors at the end of the stick, I find the idea very good, but as said, I don\u0027t find it a \"requisite\", but rather an attempt (or exception) should the \"normal\", \"proper\" way be not working.\n* Though I myself have been trying for several years to convey the idea that the \"proper\" way to partition/format any HD-like media is having an initial smallish FAT16 partition and all the rest as one or more Logical Volumes inside Extended partition, following the good advise by Gilles Vollant, and this is the particular way with which I personally partition/format ALL my HD-like devices, this does not necessarily means that it is ***needed*** to do so.

(please note that it is not necessary to have bootable MBR CODE in first sector, ONLY one valid partition entry and the magic bytes 55AA at the end of sector)\nReally, since the already mentioned procedure in order to increase my UFDs bootability is reliably working for me then I\u0027ve not been more interested in HD-like feature/behaviour of my UFDs under Windows provided by HP Format Tool, because I\u0027ve been more interested in my UFDs behaviour booting-BIOSes-related, and then in a better and wider compatibility about the best (that\u0027s also the simpler and the less tweaked possible) way for me in order to reach this goal.  \nMy experienced results about the initial and *una tantum* partitioning of my UFDs with XP\u0027s Disk Management (\\\u003e \"Format-it-\\\u0026-Forget-it\" way) have been very effective for me and then until now I have been able to boot my UFDs on every machine I\u0027ve tried, but not the same thing occurs with HP Format Tool and/or with a MBR created in a different way.  \nAnd yes, the MBR of my UFDs created with the above mentioned way (\"Format-it-\\\u0026-Forget-it\") just contains the \"magic 55 AA bytes\" at the end of the sector. :smile:   \n\n```\n00 00 00 00 00 2C 44 63 6D C3 43 B9 00 00 80 01\n\n01 00 06 FE FF CF 3F 00 00 00 91 3F EF 00 00 00\n\n00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n\n00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n\n00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 55 AA\n```\n\nFurthermore performing my some tests about MBR I\u0027ve noticed that replacing the MBR of my UFD is a practice working related to the partitioning and it is unfortunely NOT working about the pure booting.

(as an example [The 1,024 Cylinder (504 MiB / 528 MB) Barrier](http://www.pcguide.com/ref/hdd/bios/sizeMB504-c.html \"External link\"))\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nI personally never found a single machine which I wasn\u0027t able to boot from with a stick partitioned into a single partition, and I was always able to \"fix\" sticks that didn\u0027t want to boot from users here on on 911CD forums, without the need to add a second partition, but it is well possible that a particular machine needs that, I trust your word for it :smile:.  \n\nIn which case, I would call it an exception, and not a requirement. *\\\u003c- and this is the point where our opinions diverge*   \n\nAs you very well know, it\u0027s almost 15 years :smile: I go around advising that ANY HD like device should be partitioned in a small FAT16 partition and one Extended with one or more Logical volumes inside it, so I do approve of the method you recommend :smile: , and I did so even before you even thought about it ![:(](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/sad.png), I simply do not find it a requirement.  \n\nTo sum up I would rate, from my experience, the levels of compatibility in booting as follows:  \n\n* 100,00% flipping removable bit\n* 90,01% Properly partitioning AND two (or more) partitions (maybe)\n* 90,00% Properly partitioning (which includes XP Disk Management, PeTOUSB - *up to 2 or 4 Gb* - MBRbatch and manually creating a partition table)\n* 80,00% HP format tool\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nAbout the HP MBR hack it is completely unrelated to one or more paritions, as clearly stated it simply skips certain BIOS calls, it is as well NOT a requirement, but rather an exception.  \n\n![:(](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/sad.png)  \n\njaclaz   \n"

Have you ever used XP disk management to partition a USB stick with a single partition?  \n\u003e 2. Have you ever seen such a stick fail booting?  \n\u003e 3. Have you ever seen the same stick, repartitioned with XP disk management into two partitions suddenly start booting on the same machine?\nSometime I doubt that I wrote what I already wrote if you still ask to me about what I already said. ![:(](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/sad.png)   \nHowever, as already said, my tests on an ASUS high-level motherboard (almost two years old): you could find a similar motherboard that refuses to boot any UFD that is not as a Hard Disk, then you could perform MY procedure partitioning with only one partition and then take a look if it boots; if it does not boot (and in that case just it does not), then you have to create 2 partitions and then take a look if it boots: and it will boot.  \nAnd if you state that  \n\u003e The only way to prove (or disprove) that it\u0027s \"better\" than \"standard\" MBR will be when you find a PC on which the \"standard\" one does not work and you try with the \"patched version\" and it works (or viceversa).\nso my above experienced issue is a reliable demonstration. ![:(](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/sad.png)  \n\nJust for the record I repeat that the filter driver is not matter about the bootability and furthermore it seems that different boot loaders are no matter the same (but in these recent posts we are not interested in that and we are not talking about that).  \nFrom \"the point of view\" of the most (all?) BIOSes, if you partition with at least 2 partitions your UFD then it will be seen as a Hard Disk with the best compatibility possible.  \n\n\u003e There is NO DIFFERENCE whatsoever if there is one, two or 23 partitions on the stick.\njaclaz, let me say one more time and let me prove that instead the difference **exists** . :smile:  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nIt seems to me that I finally found **where** is the matter. ![:(](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/sad.png)   \n\nI\u0027ve compared the MBRs of the same UFD where I created in different steps  \n\n**a.** 2 partitions with XP\u0027s Disk Management;  \n\n**b.** 1 partition with HP Format Tool;  \n\n**c.** 1 partition with XP\u0027s Disk Management.  \n\nMy findings are in the related screenshots of the 3 different and compared MBRs:  \n\n[![Posted Image](http://www.hostanyimage.com/files/td9j5rsuztirdxdzst22.png)](http://www.hostanyimage.com/ \"External link\")  \n\n**a.** When 2 partitions are created on your UFD (with Disk Management console) then the resulting MBR has its Signature **with just 2 bytes** ; this fact achieves the highest bootability from your UFD.  \n\n```\n55 AA\n```\n\n**b.** When HP Format Tool is used then the resulting MBR has its Signature **with further 2 (two) bytes added** ; this fact achieves an average bootability from your UFD;  \n\n```\n00 00 55 AA\n```\n\n**c.** When only one single partition is created on your UFD (with Disk Management console) then the resulting MBR has its Signature **with further 12 (twelve) bytes added** ; this fact achieves a low bootability from your UFD.  \n\n```\n00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 55 AA\n```\n\nFurthermore, if you state that the flipping of the removable-bit is 100% working, and I state that my \"Format-it-\\\u0026-Forget-it\" way (that\u0027s creating 2 partitions on your UFD) succeeds EXACTLY as the flipping of the removable-bit does, then my \"Format-it-\\\u0026-Forget-it\" way (that\u0027s creating 2 partitions on your UFD) is 100% working.  \n\nAs matter of fact my \"Format-it-\\\u0026-Forget-it\" way works where other ways work, and my \"Format-it-\\\u0026-Forget-it\" way works where other ways do NOT work.  \n\nAnd the reason **seems** :smile: to be all in those few bytes of difference in the created MBR of your UFD performing my \"Format-it-\\\u0026-Forget-it\" way. ![:(](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/sad.png)   \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nThank you (all) for your patience. ![:(](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/sad.png)   \n"

(you cannot define me as an \"expert\" and right after ignore my experience on the specific field, or, to be more exact, you ***can*** ![:(](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/sad.png), but it\u0027s not nice :smile:: do make up your mind, you either trust me and try to follow my suggestions or you decide that I am a crazy nut that posts random things in order to undermine your findings)\n* The reason why that particular machine boots if there are two partitions is **unknown** :smile:, but ***in my opinion*** it is to be found in it\u0027s BIOS.\n* It\u0027s ***your*** idea, ***your*** finding, ***your*** everything, noone is going to deprive ***you*** of the paternity of the observation. :smile:\n* Due to point #2 above, it is***my opinion*** that having two or more partitions is not a \"general\" requisite for USB bootability, meaning that it will increase the bootability of the stick only in a very small number of cases, at the moment we totaled 1 (one) such report\n* Since it doesn\u0027t make ANY harm, expecially because if the stick is partitioned with a \"balanced\" CHS and LBA you will have anyway some spare sectors at the end of the stick, I find the idea very good, but as said, I don\u0027t find it a \"requisite\", but rather an attempt (or exception) should the \"normal\", \"proper\" way be not working.\n* Though I myself have been trying for several years to convey the idea that the \"proper\" way to partition/format any HD-like media is having an initial smallish FAT16 partition and all the rest as one or more Logical Volumes inside Extended partition, following the good advise by Gilles Vollant, and this is the particular way with which I personally partition/format ALL my HD-like devices, this does not necessarily means that it is ***needed*** to do so.

(as an example [The 1,024 Cylinder (504 MiB / 528 MB) Barrier](http://www.pcguide.com/ref/hdd/bios/sizeMB504-c.html \"External link\"))\n\u003e\n\u003e \u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003e\nthat only you can answer to by experimenting, but that you decided to ignore :smile:, in favour of the, without abusing of my \"expert\" status, ***queer*** theory of *different* 00\u0027s :smile: .  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nIf I were you, I would repeat the comparison using tinyhexer:  \n[http://www.mirkes.de/files/](http://www.mirkes.de/files/ \"External link\")  \n[http://www.mirkes.de/files/mpth_18.exe](http://www.mirkes.de/files/mpth_18.exe \"External link\")  \n\nWith a net saving of at least €37.76:  \n[http://www.sweetscape.com/010editor/](http://www.sweetscape.com/010editor/ \"External link\")  \n\u003e Commercial Use: $129.95 US   \n\u003e Home/Academic Use: $49.95 US\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nDifferent bytes will become **green** which is a more \"neutral\" colour, identical bytes will remain \"white\".  \n\nOnce you will be convinced yourself that 00\u0027s are 00\u0027s, you might want to reconsider experimenting in the direction suggested by my open questions, in order to try and find WHAT is causing the behaviour you observed.  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\njaclaz   \n"

 \n2) \"grldr\" and \"menu.lst\" copied in the root of the 1st partition;  \n3) all supported application copied in the \"boot\" folder of the 2nd partition.  \n4) \"menu.lst\" entries pointed to (hd0,1)/boot/.  \n\n\u003e i mean will grub4dos can load another floppy image or menu.lst from second partition too ?\nYes, even if that partition is not accessible under Windows without an installed filter driver.  \nOf course you must have a filter driver installed on your current Windows PC just in order to copy all supported applications to the 2nd partition.  \n\n\u003e because what i could understand the MBR installs at first (primary fat32) partition there for bios corresponds with it first when loading the main grub4dos ?\nI\u0027m not sure of having understood, however once you have installed \"grub4dos\" in the MBR of your UFD then you can do almost all what you want: really grub4dos is a great boot loader and it has many features, and other ones are added in the latest releases.  \nIn this case it is enough that grub4dos is installed in the MBR of your UFD and that \"grldr\" and \"menu.lst\" are copied in the root of the 1st partition: from here (that\u0027s for grub4dos Menu screen at startup) you can chainload your supported applications from any partition they are on your UFD (the only things that change are the related entries in your \"menu.lst\").  \n\n\u003e 2. lets say i want to image this 2 GB flash drive on multiple 2 GB flash drives , then should i use ghost clone option to clone this flash drive on multiple flash drives and ultimately they ll have same bootability ,i mean those 2 partitions will clone to other flash drives too ?\nYes, but at least in my experience in order to be sure that then it will boot then those other flash drive have to be first (or before) prepared by XP\u0027s Disk Management.  \nThat\u0027s: you have a new UFD; then you installed it on your current Windows PC with a filter driver installed; then you partition it in 2 partitions and then you install grub4dos in its MBR.  \nAfter that you can restore your image backups on the new and just prepared partitions of your UFD and then it will work.  \n\n\u003e currently what i have tested is that , i made a 2 GB flash drive multiboot with grub4dos , and made a gho image of it . then restored it to my friend\u0027s system , and it worked fine , just wondering after having ur \" format and forget it\" applied on my 2 GB flash drive , can it be mirrored as it is to other 2 GB flash drive , but im still having confusion that if my current menu.lst and options will work fine as they were made for single partitioned flash drive ( the one i showed MBR to u above) .\nHere it seems to me there is a bit of confusion: really performing the \"Format-it-\\\u0026-Forget-it\" way you create 2 partition on your UFD with a smaller one (almost 250 MB) at the end of your UFD and in any file-system, but then you will use only the larger.  \nIn other words: the 2nd and last partition is useful just for a better bootability of your UFD not for other uses; and on all the machines where a filter driver is not installed the smaller partition (250 MB) will be not accessible under Windows.  \nThis fact is not matter, how you can see: you will use your UFD exactly how if it had only one partition (that\u0027s as all removable devices have).  \nThe difference is that a removable device could not boot from certain machines, instead the double partitioning should assure the UFD bootability also from those certain machines (that\u0027s an increased bootability).  \n\nReally when we talking about the 2 partitions we can have 2 situations:  \n1. the case just described: 2 partitions, but only the first and the larger in use; the smaller (250 MB) you have to forget.  \nSo it is exactly how if you have a normal UFD with only one partition, even if for better bootability you have created two, but the 2nd one you have to forget, as if it did not exist.  \nSo you will use your UFD exactly as any USB removable device (\\\u003e only one partition allowed) and the image backups will work exactly the same.  \nThe difference consists in the increased bootability.  \n2. you create 2 partitions on your UFD, but the 2nd one is not so small: instead of 250 MB it is 1 GB in size (just as an example).  \nIn this case you will have increase your UFD bootability because it is partitioned with 2 partitions, but of course you will want **to use** that 1 GB of space.  \nIn this case is valid what I already said above in my first answer.  \n\nIt appears almost complicated to describe, but very simple to realize and to do.  \n\nReally you can make up to 4 primary partitions on your UFD, and if you accept the fact that under Windows if a filter diriver is not installed then only the active partition will be accessible you can create even a multiple Full XP environment (grub4dos supported applications included) in almost a couple of hours. :smile:   \n"

      "content": "Hi  \nI have been reading this post with interest. I am very familiar with USB booting and have written several utilities to partition, format and add boot sectors to them to make instantly bootable UFDs.  \nFirst when you say \u0027bootable\u0027 you need to define the device you are trying to emulate. For instance, you can boot MS-DOS from UFD and it will recognise the UFD as either A: or C: (i.e. a floppy disk or hard disk).  \nIn this discussion I presume you are referring to hard disk emulation.  \n\nNow the job of a BIOS when attempting to boot from a UFD is to discover if it should boot as a 1.44MB floppy, large floppy drive (ZIP emulation) or hard disk.  \n\nThe 1.44Mb Floppy drive is usually determined by the USB device ID (reports as a TEAC floppy drive). e.g. The Netac UFD U207 has a 1.44MB emulation mode switch and can appear as a 1.44MB floppy drive to the BIOS. This boots exactly like a floppy drive and uses int 13h DL\u003d0 to access the device.  \n\nSo the next job for the BIOS is to determine if the UFD is a USB-ZIP or USB-HDD (using int 13h DL\u003d80h). If the BIOS boots the device as a USB-ZIP device it loads the VBR but adds the LBA position of the VBR from any direct access. This can be ascertained because if you boot a USB-ZIP device to MS-DOS (as A: drive) and then access LBA 0 - you get the VBR and not the MBR (which is actually at LBA 0 but no longer accessible once booted due to the BIOS adding the VBR position offset). Thus the device appears to the OS as a large floppy drive (but accessible via int 13h DL\u003d80h).  \n\nThe BIOS needs to determine whether to boot with this special \u0027ZIP\u0027 translation or not. Different BIOSes use different ways to do this. Some are:  \n1. Single ptn in 4th position in table (not personally observed this)  \n2. FAT16 ptn with 64h 32s geometry in MBR table (not sure which of the 4 entries it uses to determine this but likely to be the first entry)  \n3. Size of device (NOT partition size) - e.g. if \\\u003c1GB then treated as ZIP else HDD  \n4. More than one partition (by definition USB-ZIP devices only have one partition table entry).  \n\nSo, to make a UFD stand more chance of booting from any BIOS AS A USB-HDD DEVICE, you may stand a better chance if it has two partition table entries, is FAT32, and if the device size is 1GB+.  \n\nIf you want a DOS bootable device to boot as A: however, you stand a better chance using a 512MB UFD, FAT16 using H64 S32 drive geometry. In addition certain bytes in the FAT VBR may need to be set to be a \u0027floppy\u0027 (bytes 15h and 24h).  \n\nSo it is quite possible that having two or more partitions increased a UFDs chance of booting in hard disk emulation mode.  \n\nHTH  \nSteve   \n"

This also makes it partitionable in XP.\n\nNice. :smile:  \n\nJust for the record, and to avoid possible misunderstanding, BootIt.exe is a specific Lexar utility, and it may work on other Brands, if they use the same controller, for other Brands, you will need another appropriate utility to \"flip the removable bit\":  \n[http://www.911cd.net...o...\u003d22874\\\u0026st\u003d8](http://www.911cd.net/forums//index.php?showtopic\u003d22874\u0026st\u003d8 \"External link\")  \n\njaclaz   \n"
