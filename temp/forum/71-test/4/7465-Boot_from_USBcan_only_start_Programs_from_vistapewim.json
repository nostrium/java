(this was just philosophy)  \n\nThere are three reasons AFAIK to use map to --mem instead of direct mapping:  \n1) no need for an unfragmented file  \n2) have a volatile write environment (which doesn\u0027t make any sense when mapping a .iso which is Read Only anyway)  \n3) if for whatever reason, direct mapping does not work  \n\nMy guess is that there isn\u0027t any differerence in speed using one or the other mapping method, but I can be proved wrong anytime, why don\u0027t you try the same (working) setup with both options and try comparing speed?  \n\n\u003e Did I make any mistake?\nYES.
