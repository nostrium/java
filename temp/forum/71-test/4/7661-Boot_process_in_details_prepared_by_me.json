Spotted a few typos and small things in need to be corrected but it\u0027s very readable nevertheless.  \n\nLiked reading about the Linux and Vista boot details. Was interesting, already knew some of the mentioned things but it was good to see them placed in context.  \n\nThank you for making the manual available.  \n\n![^_^](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/happy.png)   \n"

      "content": "Hi Nour El2mar,  \n\nWhat can I say, a great article and really accurate. A valuable piece of information and quite thorough too. There are some typos and gramatical errors but I\u0027m really being picky here. Well done.  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n\u003e I see first sector of any device as the Master Boot Record, which can contain either MBR code (partitioned device) or Partition Boot Record code (unpartitioned device).  \n\u003e jaclaz\n\nSorry jaclaz but I have to disagree with you slightly.  \n\nTo me **Master Boot Record** should fit the following criteria:  \n\\* First sector on a disk  \n\\* Contains bootstrap code  \n\\* Contains partition table  \n\nAnd the **Boot Sector**   \n\\* First sector of the partition (or disk)  \n\\* Contains bootstrap code  \n\\* Contains file system description (ie signature, geometry etc)  \n\nTypically removable media (think floppy disks and optical disks) has only one partition therefore the first sector on a disk is always a Boot Sector. This seems to apply to USB Flash Drives too. That is the main reason we have to \"reformat\" them with a special tool which actually adds the partition table and make flash drive look hard drive alike to BIOS so it can boot properly.  \n\nActually in some cases term \"Boot sector\" is no longer the most accurate term. For example on FAT32 file system \"boot sector\" consists of 3 sectors. So name (Volume/Partition) Boot Record used by Nour El2mar would be more accurate. But personally if I see VBR I instantly think of Variable Bit Rate :smile:   \n"
