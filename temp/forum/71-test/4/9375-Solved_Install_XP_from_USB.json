      "content": "Thanks for this tutorial!!!  \n\nI got everything working using an NTFS formatted memory key but am having one problem. After the first reboot I choose the second option for the GUI part of the install and it comes up like a normal install and starts the process of \"Installing Devices\". It get a little over half way done and I get one of the \"not passed the logo testing\" pop ups, it seems to be trying to install a driver for \"Microsoft UAA Function Driver for High Defenition Audio -adi 1983\". It says do you want to continue installing the software, yes or no. The problem here is I have no mouse or keyboard functionality to click yes.:smile:  \n\nI started over again to make sure I had a mouse before this and I did. While it was \"Installing Devices\" the red light on my mouse was on and I could move the pointer, right before I got the popup the red light went out and the pointer disappeared from the screen.  \n\nAny ideas???  \n\nThanks,  \nScott   \n"

      "content": "Thanks I will check those out. I was testing the D: key as I posted and ran into a problem and I am not sure is related. I tested the XP install on the same machine before and just tried it again to make sure everything was working. Now for some reason I get a \"Files Needed\" box popup during the \"Installing Devices\" portion of the XP install. It is asking for HDaudio.sys on D:\\\\$WIN_NT%.\\~LS\\\\I386, I now get the same problem on the other key but is asking in U: (U:\\\\$WIN_NT%.\\~LS\\\\I386) instead of D: which is expected. The file exists in those directories but is hdaudio.sy_ and I guess gets uncompressed at install. I tried re-copying the files from my XPSOURCE folder to the key with no help.  \nNow a couple of posts up I had a problem with a \"logo testing\" popup that I could not clear because my keyboard and mouse was not recognized at that time (works before and after) but Wimb helped me with that. So when I get this new popup I don\u0027t have keyboard and mouse use to investigate further. By coincidence this is the same component (UAA Function Driver for High Definition Audio) that I had the issue with the \"logo test\" ![:D](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/biggrin.png)   \n\nAny Ideas??   \n"
