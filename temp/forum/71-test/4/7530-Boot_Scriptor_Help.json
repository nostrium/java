I am trying to get a boot CD that was created using it ported to a USB stick.  \n\nI can\u0027t even get boot scriptor scripts to run properly in the debugger.... possible Vista issue maybe?  \n\nI have been successful creating a Vista install stick, XP install stick, UBCD stick and a few of my own... but this Techie\u0027z Toolkit (with boot scriptor) has me stumped.   \n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.  \n\nThanks in advance.  \n\nronbeck   \n"
