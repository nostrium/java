Since I can boot the tablet into XP with my USB Multiboot thumb drive I was able to run TESTDISK and fix the MBR with the MBR Code option. The tablet will then boot into XP just fine. :wink:   \n\nZenImaging 7 has been always been problematic for us the last few years, especially on the Lenovo tablets. We can never get an image that actually boots without some intervention on our part. Sometimes we have to login with a Live Linux CD to flag our NTFS partition as bootable and delete some other mystery partition. Other times we have to boot from an XP SP2 Cd and run chkdsk, fixboot and/or fixmbr. Each image that we create has a unique set of problems and fixes. It has motivated me to learn more about the MBR and boot sectors (I have a long way to go because I didn\u0027t understand a good portion or your reply). Thanks again for telling me about TESTDISK. I now have another tool for my boot problem toolbox.   \n"
