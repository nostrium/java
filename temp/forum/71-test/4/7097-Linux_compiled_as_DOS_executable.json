I would be interested to see a whole distro including gui based uppon Linux.exe.  \n\nAny other ideas for what Linux.exe could be useful?   \n"

      "content": "New idea...  \n\nLinux.exe is theoretically quite handy. kexec can be used in order to fast reboot linux without going thought BIOS again. One limitation of kexec is that it can only chanboot other linux kernels but no other operating systems such as linux. On the other hand we have grub.exe and the possibility to start (almost?) any operating system from a bootable device supported by BIOS (or BIOS extender such as PLoP).  \n\nIf we can shutdown linux.exe and return to DOS this can be easy combined with starting grub.exe from DOS.  \n\nThe only technical unknown thing in this mulitbooting DOS, Windows, Linux scenario is to shutdown Windows and to return to grub.exe without going thought BIOS again. I think this hasn\u0027t been implemented yet.  \n\nYes, it\u0027s also already possible to use kexec to chainboot grub.exe directly, but this isn\u0027t working always [reliable](http://www.boot-land.net/forums/index.php?showtopic\u003d7217 \"External link\"). It\u0027s still questionable whenever it is more reliable to shutdown linux.exe and to start grub.exe from DOS compared to using kexec from linux directly. However, it will be more easy to debug grub.exe inside pure DOS compared to from kexec/linux?  \n\nSoon I will try to get my own linux.exe and tell you whenever I can chainboot grub.exe better then directly with kexec.  \n\n(I\u0027ve posted this already on the [kexec-mailing](http://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/kexec/2009-February/003223.html \"External link\") list without feedback.)   \n"
