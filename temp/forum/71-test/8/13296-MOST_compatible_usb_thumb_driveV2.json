He says : no cd in drive, so plop can not see usb-cdrom.  \n\nBut this is most compatible pendrive ever - if wont boot usb-cdrom he will boot usb-hdd.  \nSo it is better than LEXAR so far, all 25 computers from year 2002 - 2010 in my work - booted fine.   \n\nIf i find not bootable - i will try to find this thread and write it here.  \n\nSo kingston has better compatible chip than sandisk cruzer titanium - when doing the same, exactly thing (cdrom and disk with gonzor customizer) - bios hangs and need to force reset.  \nKingston works , sandisk - does not.  \n\nUSBDEVVIEW:  \n\nPort_#0005.Hub_#0005 SKY USB USB Device Mass Storage Yes Yes No No E:, K: 899000000000000025795903 2010-12-10 12:01:28 2010-12-11 08:24:49 1516 1603 2.00 08 06 50 USBSTOR USB Mass Storage Driver USBSTOR.SYS USB @usbstor.inf,%generic.mfg%;Compatible USB storage device 100 mA USB Mass Storage Device 6.1.7600.16385   \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nDEVMANVIEW:  \n\nSKY USB USB Device (Standard disk drives) disk DiskDrive Disk drives USBSTOR\\\\Disk\\\u0026Ven_SKY\\\u0026Prod_USB\\\u0026Rev_1.00\\\\899000000000000025795903\\\u00260 0x00000010 0x00000000 No Yes 2010-12-11 08:24:49 Disk drive 6.1.7600.16385 disk.inf disk_install.NT 2006-06-21 2010-12-10 12:01:50   \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nSKY USB USB Device (Standard CD-ROM drives) cdrom CDROM DVD/CD-ROM drives USBSTOR\\\\CdRom\\\u0026Ven_SKY\\\u0026Prod_USB\\\u0026Rev_1.00\\\\899000000000000025795903\\\u00261 0x00000010 0x00000000 No Yes 2010-12-11 08:24:49 CD-ROM Drive 6.1.7600.16385 cdrom.inf cdrom_install 2006-06-21 2010-12-10 12:01:52   \n\n**Edited by mateuszek, 11 December 2010 - 07:34 AM.**\n"
