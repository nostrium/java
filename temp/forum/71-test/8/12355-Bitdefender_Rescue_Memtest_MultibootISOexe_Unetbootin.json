      "content": "Ok, so I know this is not the PenDriveLinux forum, there\u0027s has been suspended, and forgive my rambling but I may have some good info or saving for someone else.  \n\ni started off with an older version some time back of Multibootiso (MBI) version 1.7.2 (there is an older one yet of 1.5.6 in my backups so who knows... either way.).  \n\nAnyways... I ended up trying and using Multibootiso v2.1.2 right over the structure created by the older version which worked flawlessly to put all the iso\u0027s on the USB Thumbdrive Flashdrive.  \n\nUntil, I copied over BitDefenders Rescue, which seemed to have numbed the boot capabilities of the Thumbdrive at that point. PLUS after re-opening MBI.exe (several times/ways) with both 2.1.2 and 1.7.2 I noticed you could no longer find MEMtest in the list of iso\u0027s/zip\u0027s?  \n\nSooo... what i ended up doing was deleting all the stuff at the root of the Thumbdrive (hp_v125) except my iso\u0027s. Then I re-used the older MBI.exe 1.7.2 and recopied a small distro, Dban, and vualla. It worked and booted.  \n\nI noticed a few distro\u0027s either quit or were not working to begin with. I\u0027ll try a recopy later and see what happens.  \n\nThe older version of MBI used alot of foldering at the root where as the new 2.1.2 simply uses the isos at the root which is sort of nice and simple, you know whats there at a glance!  \n\nPlus, I had about 1.5gb\u0027z of files on the Thumbdrive I have not lost yet :ThumbzUp:  \n\nTho I did use some format tool initially way back. Which One .. \\*shrug\\*  \n\nAnyone else had this problem or know of a workaround? I\u0027ve yet to try Unetbooting or FBinst.  \n\nI\u0027d love to do the whole Unix command line thing but I just dont have the time.  \n\nThank You For Your Replies and Idea\u0027s!  \n\nTZ  \n\nThe last questions are/were about using something to partition a drive with XP on it. I want to eventually move XP to the second partition so I can use some other Linux boot. Plus I would like to backup the entire current contents to a USB stick as well as the second partition. I can always image the USB back to the Hard drive, but i know somewhere I have seen something that allows some kind of interaction to an image on the same drive!  \n\nWhat are my options. TY!   \n"

      "content": "Ok, so this is where I am at...  \n\nAnd like I said, excuse my ramblings, its what this world does to you when you get old and lose your marbles.  \n\nUsing MBI or Unetbootin, Bitdefender installs to your USB Thumbdrive/Flashdrive as a sole proprietor of the device. In other words, if you have other items on that device with a bootable option, Bitdefender is not going to play nice with them. I see MBI 212 .4 is out now but I am guessing it will not fix this issue.   \n\nBitdefender just hangs in space with no prompts to notify you of what it is doing behind the blank screen it eventually shows while thrashing around my drive. What good does it do to scan my drive with outdated tools? After about 10 minutes, I hit the power after trying to cancel it.  \n\nI tested out Kapersky, AVG (AntiVirus by Grisoft), and Avira up next. KaV, I found a slick script to update the iso previous to running it! Nice Touch people. KAV (Kapersky AntiVirus) didn\u0027t get put to work either. Something about it prompted me to question. I really didn\u0027t like the initial interface, it was lacking an option. If any, just scan and display results. But it did better then Bitdefender since BD gave me no options, or info. ....AVG, I dont remember where I was with AVG but I still have hopes for it.  \n\nHere is the KAV info I recompiled with some links for any interested. The article has links for reference from Bharat who was very kind to reconvey the correct info and as such this is simply a recompilation:   \n\nKAV Updater: [http://agnipulse.com.../#ixzz0yosyokLD](http://agnipulse.com/2010/03/kaspersky-rescue-disk-10/#ixzz0yosyokLD \"External link\")  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*  \n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* SHORTFORM \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*  \n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*   \n\nThe virus definitions in this rescue disk are out of date as soon as KAV releases them. The rescue disk has the option to update the virus definitions from the internet but the updates are not saved. You will need to update them everytime you want to use the Rescue CD.  \n\nOk, this is the shortform:   \n\nThe article is misleading as you dont need all the files but you will need the right ISO....   \n\nHere are the simple steps for updating the 2010 iso...   \n\n1.) Download the 200mb ISO, this is for the 2010,   \n\n[http://rescuedisk.ka...edisk/updatable](http://rescuedisk.kaspersky-labs.com/rescuedisk/updatable \"External link\")  \n\nor  \n\n[http://devbuilds.kas...s/RescueDisk10/](http://devbuilds.kaspersky-labs.com/devbuilds/RescueDisk10/ \"External link\")  \n\n2.) download the Batch updater from Bahrat Balegere (kasresupdten.1)   \n\n[http://static.agnipu...resupdten.1.zip](http://static.agnipulse.com/downloads/kasresupdten.1.zip \"External link\")  \n\n3.) Extract/unzip the kasresupdten.1 zip file to a folder of your choice.   \n\n4.) Copy the kav_rescue_10.iso into the newly created folder that contains the file \"diskupdt.cmd\" from the downloaded kasresupdten.1.zip file.  \n\n5.) Run the diskupdt.cmd by double clicking the file.  \n\nThe updater will prompt you several times to continue. This could take take a little while to update depending on your internet connection as there is about 9 Megabytes of downloads required and then recompiling the ISO.  \n\nOnce this operation is complete there will be a new file named \"kav_rescue_2010.iso\" in the same folder as your batch file and the original ISO.  \n\n6.) Burn the new ISO to a disc or use something like MultibootISO or Unetbootin to install it to a Thumbdrive.  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n-------Thats it  \n\nAgain, thanx to Bharat for the updated info!   \n\nI recently came across Puppy which was also wants to be the only rooter as does a couple others I have tried. Not that I am trying to pour rain on anything but puppy needs a neater desktop, and a few more basic options for keyboard commands to help with GUI desktop/file navagation. Then again, I guess it could just be for puppies who have no clue about what paper training means \\*shrug\\*  \n\nAnd finaly, Is there a way to keep these distros from tossing stuff all over my drive? A way to force them to either install to a folder or simply remain as a single ISO by themselves at the root?   \n\n- Z  \n\npss... EDIT: Bharat updated the page to include better info! TY Bharat :)   \n"
