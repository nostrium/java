      "content": "It is well known that almost any flavor of windows can be booted into from a pendrive.Similarly,is there any way i can have the entire OS in a 32 gb microsd card which is contained in any windows mobile phone.This phone,when connected to the usb port,should act as the sd-card-reader/pendrive.  \nhowever windows mobile based phones do not show up as usb mass storage/pendrive in windows xp/7 explorer on pc.But still,its possible using 3rd party software  \n\nAccording to [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_mass-storage_device_class \"External link\"):  \nWindows Mobile devices can not show their file systems as a mass storage device unless the device implementer explicitly decides to add such functionality. However, third party applications exist to add MSC emulation to most WM devices (commercial \"Softick CardExport\" and free \"WM5torage\"). Generally only memory cards can be exported, and not internal storage memory, due to the complications with filesystems outlined in the Device access section.  \n\nbut i dont know if its possible for BIOS of windows pc to recognise the phone as pendrive(because i think wm5torage makes it possible after the OS has booted).If this is possible,i would like to know if all encrypted containers(created using freeOTFE4PDA in the microsd card),when mounted(using freeOTFE4PDA),are available as additional drives in windows explorer in pc.If this also becomes possible then,i can have an encrypted OS(or atleast the boot files) in an encrypted container created using freeOTFE4PDA- which is what my aim is   \n"
