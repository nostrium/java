If not, what is written to MBR of the Thumb - Plop, which you now try to replace with Grub4DOS MBR? In that case, what was originally written to the Thumb\u0027s MBR after you formatted it with the above tool and installed OS?  \n\n--------------------------------------  \n\nAs to booting the Thumb HD after booting to its FDD (more accurately just launching Plop that way but not booting OS on the FDD), the Plop developer when [***asked***](http://www.boot-land.net/forums/index.php?showtopic\u003d12781 \"External link\") abundantly [***stressed***](http://www.boot-land.net/forums/index.php?showtopic\u003d12781\u0026view\u003dfindpost\u0026p\u003d111949 \"External link\") that when you use Plop HD Menu, Plop can ONLY boot the USB HD device selected as first boot device in BIOS, or you **must reconfigure** the Thumb HDD boot files properly, setting the Thumb\u0027s drive letter according to its current order in BIOS drive list. Editing boot.ini is not required, when booting same Thumb from Plop USB Menu.  \n\nAlso he [***said***](http://www.boot-land.net/forums/index.php?showtopic\u003d12781\u0026view\u003dfindpost\u0026p\u003d111852 \"External link\"), when you use **Plop HD Menu** items, BIOS routing is used to boot the item you selected (and it may fail to boot the USB HD Thumb). When you use **Plop USB Menu** item, Plop own routing and driver is used to boot the same item you selected (and it may also fail for a different reason, but offers yet another boot method). Which item from what Plop Menu did you use?  \n\nWonko suggested you to try chainloading Grub4DOS from Plop, or possibly installing Grub4DOS MBR to the Thumb FDD instead of Plop MBR. Have you done that? Try using *find --set root* method to avoid setting fixed Thumb HD volume number.  \n\nTry answering separately each question stated in this post (i.e. with a question mark \"?\").

      "content": "I had time to do only quick experiment today.  \nSo here is symbolization:  \nfloppy device (1)  \nmass storage dev (previosly (2)) will now be -  \nas removable \u003d (2r)  \nas fixed (2f).  \n\nExperiment one:  \nAward bios 2008 year.  \nInsert pendrive - on (1) - plop, on (2r) vista pe.  \nselecting from f12 boot menu usb-hdd (only this one works, all others usb modes not, neither usb-zip neither usb-fdd)  \nso it loads plop, as in first post, and this plop can only boot system on internal drives, he can not boot vistape i had on (2r).  \nGoing into bios (del) and i wanted to change hard disk boot priority but there is nothing more than without thumb drive.  \nBios did not see (2r) as another hdd.  \n\nexperiment two:  \ninsert pendrive on (1) plop and now i changed (2r) to be (2f).  \nselect boot menu - usb hdd or any other - nothing, skipped, loaded windows on internal drivers.  \nSo i rebooted and go into bios menu (del) and now he could see (2f) as another drive, i changed boot priority and vistape loaded.  \n\nexperiment three:  \nI had to go to another computer because guy working on previous told me that he had to do something important.  \nSo i went to another room where i knew was award bios.  \nSo i started it with pendrive.  \nAND NOW LOOK AT THIS STUPID SHIT  \nAward 2009 (not 2008 but now new computer with new bios, award, BUT 2009) and THIS STUPID SHIT wont boot any of this thumb drives, but in menu bios (del) he saw (1) and (2f) and later (2r) as USB-HDD but when i changed boot priorities this SHIT TOLD ME THIS STUPID meaningless text:  \nDISK READ ERROR  \non every try, on (1) as first boot, (2f) as first boot and later on (2r) as first boot.  \n\nI was so disappointed i would like to kill everything with dban.   \n\nIf only bios firmware model mess everything there is no way to make 100% compatible thumb drive.  \n\nAnd this is bios thing.  \n\nI inserted another pendrive - transcend-  \n\n(so now i had connected to pendrives 1- transcend and second lexar with (1) and (2f))  \n\n-with only one device set as fixed disk, fbinst on it, run outer menu.lst, loaded command line grub switched root to (hd3,0) \u003d pendrive lexar with (1) and (2f) and normally loaded vistape.  \n\nSo having 2 pendrives - one normal and one modded is more compatible than having only 1 pendrive.  \nMaybe if i will have time i will do more experiments.   \n"

      "content": "So, the first 3 experiments you did with Plop installed on Floppy, and not using Grub4DOS at all? Of them 2 were successful with Award 2008, and the 3-d failed with Award 2009?  \n\nThe 4-th experiment you did with 2 Thumbs, without using Plop, but instead used Grub4DOS installed on USB Thumb Floppy, and used its command line to chainload VistaPE on Thumb HD? And it did work, because USB superfloppy place was occupied by Transcend, so in fact you had 2 USB Floppies recognized in the system.  \n\nSo, what is your next test plan?   \n"

      "content": "Plop developer said that when you use Plop USB Menu (instead of Plop HD Menu), it uses its own detection instead of BIOS detection. But Plop driver is not universal enough to boot any Thumb with any chipset, especially the latest ones. Also it attempts to recognize the Thumb\u0027s chipset limited number of times. That\u0027s why my Sandisk Blade at times booted with Plop and at times didn\u0027t.  \n\nThere is another option to boot a Floppy diskette first, and then boot your USB Thumb from that diskette. But I don\u0027t think, you\u0027re up-to it. Not clear so far, **what Plop Menu** you were using when booting the 2-nd drive: HD or USB?  \n\nYet another important factor, I mentioned in the above linked [***Tutorial***](http://www.boot-land.net/forums/index.php?showtopic\u003d13171 \"External link\"), is about Thumb geometry and *jaclaz* \u0027s paper on that topic - its right at the top of the Tutorial. So it may be wise for you to try this: wipe your Thumb, and then follow that paper to set correct Thumb geometry. Award 2009 BIOS may boot your Thumb after that. I guess, you used SMI Chip Utility to format the Thumb - now try other tools from that paper. It can make the difference you look for, and for starters you might not even need to divide the Thumb into 2 drives. ![:worship:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/worship.gif)  \n\nThe last thing to remember, there may be NO universal solution currently available, given key BIOS role in boot process, and great number of BIOS versions on the market. Not everything depends on the end user, no matter how hard you try. Not to discourage you, but a reality bit. ![:worship:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/worship.gif)   \n"
