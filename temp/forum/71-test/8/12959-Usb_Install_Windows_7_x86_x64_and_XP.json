      "content": "i\u0027m working on the exact same project, although i included a kaspersky rescue disk as well. anyways, the point that i got to was getting everything on except hiren\u0027s, the reason is that winxp takes about 2 hours to install from stick if the file system is fat32, it works fine if you change it to ntfs but hiren\u0027s boot cd dosn\u0027t work from ntfs.   \n\nanyways, to get everything on except hiren\u0027s this is what i did: first copy your xp from cd or unpack from image and follow the instructions in step 2 XP-Source Preparation in this guide here: [http://www.boot-land...?showtopic\u003d4900](http://www.boot-land.net/forums/index.php?showtopic\u003d4900 \"External link\") namely the integration of the masstorage driver pack into the build to minimize risk of errors while installing on different types of hards.  \nthen follow the first part of this guide here: [http://www.boot-land...?...\u003d11930\\\u0026st\u003d0](http://www.boot-land.net/forums/index.php?showtopic\u003d11930\u0026st\u003d0 \"External link\") but in step 7 choose to format the stick as ntfs instead of fat32, in step 11 choose the folder where you have the xp setup files you modified earlier and in step 13 don\u0027t copy anything, rather create a menu.lst that looks like this:  \n\ncolor white/black white/blue  \ndefault /default  \n\ntitle Install Windows XP  \nroot (hd0,0)  \nconfigfile /winsetup.lst  \nsavedefault  \n\ntitle Install Windows 7  \nroot (hd0,0)  \nchainloader /bootmgr  \n\nand create a winsetup.lst that looks like this:  \n\ncolor white/black white/blue  \ndefault /default  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\ntitle first part  \nroot (hd0,0)  \nchainloader (hd0,0)/$WIN_NT$.\\~BT/SETUPLDR.BIN  \nsavedefault 1  \n\ntitle second part  \nroot (hd0,0)  \nchainloader (hd0,0)/NTLDR  \nsavedefault  \n\nbtw i\u0027m not sure if all are like that but there are images out there with windows 7 x86 and x64 in one, grab one of those for this.  \n\nadd the live xp image using make_usb.exe from [http://wimb.winbuild...ad\u003dU_XP_SET.exe](http://wimb.winbuilder.net/downloads/?dir\u003d\u0026download\u003dU_XP_SET.exe \"External link\") . all you need to specify in this tool is the drive letter of the usb stick in \"boot image file\" the path to the livexp_wim.iso (you can uncheck \"copy u_xp_set folder\") and hit go.  \n\ni\u0027m not sure if this appends to or replaces your menu.lst but in any case it should look like this:  \n\ntitle Boot LiveXP  \nmap (hd0,0)/LiveXP_WIM.ISO (0xff)  \nmap --hook  \nroot (0xff)  \nchainloader (0xff)  \n\ntitle Install Windows XP  \nroot (hd0,0)  \nconfigfile /winsetup.lst  \nsavedefault  \n\ntitle Install Windows 7  \nroot (hd0,0)  \nchainloader /bootmgr  \n\nas for the linux ... depends which one you want to use.   \n"
