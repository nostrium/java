Obviously you must restore RAW image backup on Removable drives of which you\u0027ve previously installed Hitachi Microdrive Filter under a working XP-USB, if not it\u0027s clear that it will not work! However, if you restore it on Fixed Disks the issue does not arise.  \n\n**11.** Done!  \n\n**12.** Now your Full XP will be able to boot and to work from a Logical Drive of any USB devices: Fixed disks and Removable drives! ![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif)   \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nThe above procedure should result in some advantages of great importance: in fact, the first FAT (and Active) partition is widely preferred by most if not all BIOSes in order to boot USB devices, then you will reach an excellent BIOS/Hardware compatibility with no special preparation and/or pre-treatment of your Removable USB Flash Drives.  \n\nOn your Removable USB Flash Drive your can create a Logical Drive with your preferred file system and it can be of any preferred size, maintaining a high compatibility with most BIOSes.  \n\nYour Logical System partition is flawlessly encryptable.  \n\nYour RAW images backup (of your encrypted or not encrypted Logical Drive) are restorable and properly working on any Removable USB Flash Drive with no pre-treatment.  \n\nFurthermore, please note that a Logical drive is obviously created inside an Extended partition, with additional advantages that this fact implies (about that, please ask to **jaclaz** ! ![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif) [http://www.boot-land...?...ost\\\u0026p\u003d40980](http://www.boot-land.net/forums/index.php?showtopic\u003d5274\u0026view\u003dfindpost\u0026p\u003d40980 \"External link\") ).  \n\nFrankly, it does not seem to me too little...  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nCheers! ![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif)   \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nBtw: for now it\u0027s all, and I did not want to wait for... further details, links and screenshots will follow shortly.   \n"

      "content": "**Full (Generic) XP SP3-Slipstreamed on USB Removable (Encrypted) Logical Drive (EWF)**   \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nI\u0027ve just realized that my previously described method is not clear enough, so let me explain my idea in a possibly clearer way. :wink:   \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n**Preamble** :  \n\nI always read that Full (Generic) XP on USB devices **must** be installed (and booted) on the First Primary (Active) Partition: and it is surely true!  \n\nNevertheless I\u0027ve recently devised a way to install and to boot Full XP on a **Logical Partition** of any Removable USB-Stick, running on *any* machine!  \n\nWith some advantages over the first.  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nThen I want to share my experiences about it...  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n**Applicability** :  \n\nMy method was born thinking about the following considerations.  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n**1.** The USB Flash Sticks are Removable devices.  \n\n**2.** The Removable devices always have one single Primary partition with the same size of the whole stick.  \n\n**3.** The booting from USB Removable devices is not too simply reachable, due to hardware-compatibility with BIOSes.  \n\n**4.** The vast majority of BIOSes strictly prefer, about the booting from USB Removable devices, the First Primary (Active) Partition in FAT file-system.  \n\n**5.** The FAT file-system has some limitations, at least in its maximum allowed size: 2.047,7 MB.  \n\n**6.** If a different file-system will be chosen for the first primary (active) partition then it will strongly reduce the BIOS/USB-Stick compatibility and then the capability to boot, with a lot of issues and a lot of artifices forcing to variously \"handle\" the Removable USB-Stick in order to make itself as \"bootable\".  \n\n**7.** The free open-source TrueCrypt (6.0a) System Partition Encryption often does not work at boot under XP on USB devices (both Removable and Fixed) if Windows is installed on the first primary (active) partition, and it seems that BestCrypt (shareware) does the same.  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nSo I thought that if I would have created on my Removable USB-Stick two partitions, the first one as a primary (active) partition in FAT and then the second one as an Extended partition with 1 (or more) Logical partition(s) inside, I would have been able to achieve the following advantages:  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n**1.** The highest level of compatibility BIOSes/USB-Sticks at booting, due to the fact that BIOSes would have always seen just a FAT partition as the first active partition.  \n\n**2.** The highest level of freedom in order to choose the preferred numbers (unlimited) of Logical Partitions (inside the Extended one).  \n\n**3.** The highest level of freedom in order to choose the preferred file-system for Logical partition (FAT32, NTFS) with any contraindications.  \n\n**4.** The highest level of freedom in order to choose the preferred partition size (the only possible limitation is due to Removable USB-Stick total size!).  \n\n**5.** The flawlessly Encryption of Logical System Partition, just where Windows resides (if wanted).  \n\n**6.** The flawlessly installation of Enhanced Write Filter RAM-REG Overlay (if wanted, but it is needed with NTFS on USB-Sticks).  \n\n**7.** And furthermore the Removable USB-Stick does NOT need ANY kind of intervention in order to make it as \"bootable\"!  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nWell, but on Removable USB Sticks it\u0027s not possible to create more than one single primary partition (large exactly as much as its maximum size) without at least some tweaks!  \n\nThis was true, but if you will use my method you will reach exactly the following: a Full (Generic) XP bootable on any machine and installed on a **Logical** (FAT32/NTFS) Partition of your Removable USB-Stick with the First Primary (Active) FAT Partition and with a Logical System Partition, **without touching your Removable USB-Stick** ! ![:whistling:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/happy22.gif)  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nSo, in order to reach the above described results you will need the following:  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n**1.** An USB Hard Disk\\* (that we will call \"Host-USB\" drive) and at least a Removable USB-Stick (that we will call \"Guest-USB\" drive).  \n\n**2.** A Windows XP installation CD-ROM created with [**NGINE**](http://www.ngine.de/article/id/8 \"External link\") method (I used XP SP3-Slipstreamed).  \n\n**3.** To partially follow Dietmar\u0027s Tutorials #3 and #6 (to make your XP-USB as XP-Generic, in order to properly boot from your USB-Stick on any machine) as described [here](http://www.boot-land.net/forums/?showtopic\u003d5315 \"External link\").  \n\n**4.** The Hitachi Microdrive Filter driver installation files.  \n\n**5.** The RAW image backup of your Guest-USB drive (then a related image backup software).  \n\n**6.** The Free Open-Source TrueCrypt 6.0a (as optional... AS OPTIONAL??? :wink: ).  \n\n**7.** EWF installation files (as optional, but needed if NTFS is on UFD!).  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n\\*Really it could be also an USB-Stick as physical Fixed Disk; so, in order to physically transform an USB-Stick as Fixed Disk, it\u0027s needed to flip its Removable Media Bit ( [http://www.911cd.net...showtopic\u003d21850](http://www.911cd.net/forums//index.php?showtopic\u003d21850 \"External link\") ) that is to TRY with Lexar BooIt software: if it works, ok; if it does not work, then you need an USB Hard Disk. However, I recently purchased for $ 40,00 a LaCie USB device that in an external size of a Credit Card contains an USB Fixed Disk 8 GB.  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n**Conclusions** (about Partitions Visibility):  \n\nPlease, think about the following: if and when you will see ALL partitions of your Removable USB-Stick this means that it has been \"transformed\" into a Fixed Disk (but remember that it happens from software-side, because you have NOT touched at all your Removable USB-Stick!), then this means that you\u0027ve booted from your Removable USB-Stick or that you\u0027ve installed Hitachi Microdrive also on the host machine!  \n\nOtherwise, if you will see only the first FAT primary (active) partition this means that you\u0027ve connected on any host machine your Removable USB-Stick not for booting, but just as a simple Removable USB-Stick.  \n\nSo if you want to use your Removable USB-Stick for shared file opearations too, then the advisable better way is to create the First Primary (Active) FAT Partition not too small, but in the largest possible size about your needs: however it will cannot be larger than 2.047,7 MB (a still respectable size to share your files!).  \n\nOtherwise, if you \"strictly\" want to share the whole size of your USB-Stick on any machine, the only way is to use the same \"microdrive\" folder that resides on your Removable USB-Stick (in \"\\\\WINDOWS\\\\system32\\\\drivers\\\\\") in order to install itself on any host machine where you \"strictly\" need!  \n\nOn the other hand if your System Partition is Encrypted (and about your data privacy it would must be just that!) then the other partitions rather than the Firts Primary (Active) FAT Partition will result not visible on any other machine, at any rate!  \n\nIn short, then you can use the first primary (active) FAT partition as your Trusted Zone, and the Logical Partition(s) as your Restricted (Encrypted) Zone!  \n\nFurthermore, if you must just share \"something\" that is in your Restricted (Encrypted) Zone then a simple booting from your Removable USB-Stick itself will be enough in order to gain the access to all what you own in that Zone and that you can easily copy into your Trusted Zone: much more time to describe it that to do it!  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nGreetings to all! :wink:   \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nBtw1: please, note that all what I\u0027ve described above is obviously valid for USB Hard Disks too!  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nBtw2: I just wonder if my method could be useful in PE environments too, but actually I\u0027m no longer too applied in PEs; so, if some dude would try it under his PE environment and then would report any kind of results then it could be a nice thing... :wink:  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n[![Posted Image](http://img142.imageshack.us/img142/8585/23766171ut9.th.png)](http://img142.imageshack.us/my.php?image\u003d23766171ut9.png \"External link\")  \nPeak Xtreme2 200X 32 GB **Removable** USB-Stick Encrypted  \n\n[![Posted Image](http://img381.imageshack.us/img381/2379/36602091ob1.th.png)](http://img381.imageshack.us/my.php?image\u003d36602091ob1.png \"External link\")  \nPeak Xtreme2 200X 32 GB Removable USB-Stick Encrypted EWF-Protected **booted** on 1st machine  \n\n[![Posted Image](http://img381.imageshack.us/img381/8360/57614578ld0.th.png)](http://img381.imageshack.us/my.php?image\u003d57614578ld0.png \"External link\")  \nPeak Xtreme2 200X 32 GB Removable USB-Stick Encrypted EWF-Protected **booted** on 2nd machine   \n"

Then copy \"microdrive\" unzipped (direct download [http://www.xpefiles....rvr1224_320.zip](http://www.xpefiles.com//files/xpfildrvr1224_320.zip \"External link\") ) folder (6 files - 20 kb) on your Host-USB in \"\\\\WINDOWS\\\\system32\\\\drivers\\\\\".  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n**10.** Connect your Guest-USB (that\u0027s your **Removable** USB-Stick) with no data inside.  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n**11.** Edit \"cfadisk.inf\" as follows: Device Manager \\\u003e Disk drives \\\u003e Select your Removable USB-Stick \\\u003e Select Details flag \\\u003e Select \"Hardware IDs\" \\\u003e Select and copy (CTRL+C) the FIRST related line.  \nThen paste this line in \"cfadisk.inf\" as follows:  \n\n*\\[cfadisk_device\\]\n%Microdrive_devdesc% \u003d cfadisk_install,**PasteTheLineHere***   \n\nPlease, note that if you wanted to use ANY your Removable USB-Stick for this purpose in order to simplify your job you can repeat the above procedure for ALL your Removable USB-Sticks (if wanted), so that your \"cfadisk.inf\" file will appear with something like the following inside:  \n\n```\n\u0026#91;cfadisk_device\u0026#93;\n\n%Microdrive_devdesc% \u003d cfadisk_install,USBSTOR\\DiskJetFlashTS2GJFV30_______8.07\n\n%Microdrive_devdesc% \u003d cfadisk_install,USBSTOR\\DiskPEAK_II_Flash_Drive_____0.00\n\n%Microdrive_devdesc% \u003d cfadisk_install,USBSTOR\\DiskPEAK_II_Flash_Drive_____1100\n\n%Microdrive_devdesc% \u003d cfadisk_install,USBSTOR\\DiskPhilips_USB_Flash_Drive_1100\n\n%Microdrive_devdesc% \u003d cfadisk_install,USBSTOR\\DiskJetFlashTS2GJFV10_______8.07\n```\n\nSo will be easiest to install Hitachi Microdrive also for ALL your Removable USB-Sticks.  \nReally you can do that in a single step: at first editing \"cfadisk.inf\" and including ALL entries related to ALL your Removable USB-Sticks, and then installing Hitachi Microdrive for all your Removable USB-Sticks in a single step, one at a time.  \n\nAfter that (and after all notes followed), you will can create a RAW image backup of your Guest-USB that will contains the Hitachi Microdrive Filter driver already installed for ALL your Removable USB-Sticks and then the same RAW image backup will can be restored and it will work on ALL your Removable USB-Sticks **with any your further intervention** !  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n**12.** In Device Manager (\\\u003e Disk drives) select your Guest-USB and update its driver with \"Hitachi Microdrive Filter driver\": Driver \\\u003e Update Driver... \\\u003e Install from a list or specific location (Advanced) \\\u003e Don\u0027t search. I will choose the driver to install. \\\u003e Have Disk... \\\u003e Browse... \\\u003e Select \"cfadisk.inf\" existing (and pre-edited!) in \"\\\\WINDOWS\\\\system32\\\\drivers\\\\microdrive\\\\\" \\\u003e OK \\\u003e Select \"Hitachi Microdrive\" in \"Model\" pane \\\u003e Next \\\u003e \"Update Driver (Compatibility) Warning\" window \\\u003e YES \\\u003e Finish \\\u003e Reboot now.  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n**13.** Repeat the Hitachi Microdrive Filter driver installation for all your Removable USB-Sticks (if wanted).  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n**14.** After the reboot(s) you will be again on your Host-USB desktop, so turn-off your machine and disconnect both your Host-USB and Guest-USB.  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n**15.** Shutdown Windows and then boot from your IDE XP: now insert your Guest-USB (Removable USB-Stick) and let Windows both to recognizes and to install it, then in Device Manager update its standard driver with Hitachi Microdrive Filter driver (\\\u003e Reboot now).  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n**16.** After the complete reboot: shutdown Windows, remove your Guest-USB and boot from your IDE XP again.  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n**17.** Create a standard image backup of your Host-USB (optional, because then you can simply do the copy of all needed files \\\u0026 folders from your Host-USB to your Guest-USB).  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n**18.** Always under your IDE XP insert your Guest-USB and both partition and format it (NOT in Quick mode) just like your Host-USB is, and make as Active the first FAT partition.  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n**19.** Restore the previously created standard image backup of your Host-USB on your Guest-USB (or simply copy all files \\\u0026 folders from your Host-USB partitions to your Guest-USB respective ones).  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n**20.** Shutdown Windows and boot from your Guest-USB in order to verify that all is going right.  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n**21.** Then shutdown Windows and boot from your IDE XP again.  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n**22.** Now create a RAW image backup of the whole your Guest-USB disk.  \n\nFrom this moment you could also *forget* your Host-USB!  \n\nIn the future if you want to add a new Removable USB-Stick to your XP-USB installation then you can do that under your just updated Guest-USB: so you will get an always updated RAW image backup of your Guest-USB that you can restore on any your Removable USB-Stick without both to install Hitachi Microdrive Filter and to partition it.  \n\nReally the RAW image backup of the whole disk is needed only if your Guest-USB have been already encrypted, but at any rate to use it allows the advantage to restore it on any Removable USB-Stick without the need to partition it (and then without the need to install Hitachi Microdrive Filter).  \n\nPlease, note that:  \n\n**a.** The Hitachi Microdrive Filter driver installation under your IDE XP (and the consequent partitioning of your Removable USB-Stick) is needed only **one** time and only for the **first** your Removable USB-Stick.  \n\n**b.** A RAW image backup of the whole your Guest-USB disk can be restored on ANY further Removable USB-Stick with any further action (so, no Hitachi Microdrive Filter and no partitioning).  \n\n**c.** A standard image backup of your Guest-USB can be restored only if your Removable USB-Stick is partitioned, that\u0027s only if Hitachi Microdrive Filter have been installed.  \n\nSo you can choose between two alternatives:  \n**\\*** to use a RAW image backup of the whole your Guest-USB disk although your Guest-USB\u0027s system partition is not encrypted: the image backup size will result larger, but then it does not need ANY further action in order to restore itself on ANY your new Removable USB-Stick;  \n**\\*** to use a standard image backup (but it is possible only if your Guest-USB\u0027s system partition is NOT encrypted) and then under your IDE XP to install Hitachi Microdrive Filter for any new Removable USB-Stick in order to partition it: the image backup size will result smaller, but then you must under your IDE XP both to install the Hitachi Microdrive Filter for any your new Removable USB-Stick and to partition it.  \nAt all events, easier to do rather than to describe!  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n**23.** Now you can restore your RAW image backup just created on (any) your new Guest-USB (Removable USB-Stick) with ANY further action (no Hitachi Microdrive Filter install and no partitioning).  \n\nPlease, note that obviously your (any) new Removable USB-Stick must be large in size enough in order to \"contain\" the RAW image backup of your Guest-USB!  \nIn other words, when you create the needed partitions of your Host-USB before the NGINE CD-ROM install you must have in mind that then the resulting RAW image backup will have the SAME total size of the whole Guest-USB disk.  \nFor example: on my Host-USB I\u0027ve created the First Primary (Active) partiton in FAT \u003d 1500 MB. Then I\u0027ve created an Extended partition \u003d 6000 MB. Then I\u0027ve created two Logical Drives inside it \u003d 4500 MB \\\u0026 1500 MB.  \nNow, when I will create a RAW image backup of the whole Guest-USB disk then the RAW image backup itself will result of a size equal to the sum of all previously created partition, that is: 1500 + 4500 + 1500 \u003d **7500 MB** (the possible remaining unallocated space is not relevant in order to can restore the image backup on other devices, but it is important when you create the RAW image backup).  \nIt\u0027s clear that then you will cannot restore that RAW image backup on any device that is **smaller** of 7500 MB in size! ![:whistling:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/happy22.gif)   \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n**24.** Done!  \nNow you can boot from your (any) **Removable USB-Stick** your Full (Generic) XP on USB **Logical** (Encrypted) Drive **with the highest level of success at booting under any BIOS(es)** , in your preferred file-system, on *any* machine, **without having *touched* your new Removable USB-Stick** ! :wink:   \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nIf needed you can use TrueCrypt (6.0a) in order to encrypt your System partiton (that is a Logical partition) when you want, then you will can re-create an actual RAW image backup that will be capable to be restored (TrueCrypt Boot Loader and Volume Header included) and to work on ALL your removable USB-Sticks with ANY your further intervention.  \n\nPlease note that you have to encrypt the System Logical Partition only (just where Windows resides), so the First Primary (Active) FAT partition, that contains only Windows boot files (7 hidden files - 320 kb), will remain not-encrypted (we called it as a \"Trusted Zone\") and then it will can be also useful regarding your file opearations and/or sharing.  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nEnjoy! :wink:   \n"

Obviously you must restore RAW image backup on Removable drives of which you\u0027ve previously installed Hitachi Microdrive Filter under a working XP-USB, if not it\u0027s clear that it will not work! However, if you restore it on Fixed Disks the issue does not arise.  \n\n**11.** Done!  \n\n**12.** Now your Full XP will be able to boot and to work from a Logical Drive of any USB devices: Fixed disks and Removable drives! ![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif)   \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nThe above procedure should result in some advantages of great importance: in fact, the first FAT (and Active) partition is widely preferred by most if not all BIOSes in order to boot USB devices, then you will reach an excellent BIOS/Hardware compatibility with no special preparation and/or pre-treatment of your Removable USB Flash Drives.  \n\nOn your Removable USB Flash Drive your can create a Logical Drive with your preferred file system and it can be of any preferred size, maintaining a high compatibility with most BIOSes.  \n\nYour Logical System partition is flawlessly encryptable.  \n\nYour RAW images backup (of your encrypted or not encrypted Logical Drive) are restorable and properly working on any Removable USB Flash Drive with no pre-treatment.  \n\nFurthermore, please note that a Logical drive is obviously created inside an Extended partition, with additional advantages that this fact implies (about that, please ask to **jaclaz** ! ![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif) [http://www.boot-land...?...ost\\\u0026p\u003d40980](http://www.boot-land.net/forums/index.php?showtopic\u003d5274\u0026view\u003dfindpost\u0026p\u003d40980 \"External link\") ).  \n\nFrankly, it does not seem to me too little...  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nCheers! ![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif)   \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nBtw: for now it\u0027s all, and I did not want to wait for... further details, links and screenshots will follow shortly.   \n"

      "content": "**Full (Generic) XP SP3-Slipstreamed on USB Removable (Encrypted) Logical Drive (EWF)**   \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nI\u0027ve just realized that my previously described method is not clear enough, so let me explain my idea in a possibly clearer way. :wink:   \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n**Preamble** :  \n\nI always read that Full (Generic) XP on USB devices **must** be installed (and booted) on the First Primary (Active) Partition: and it is surely true!  \n\nNevertheless I\u0027ve recently devised a way to install and to boot Full XP on a **Logical Partition** of any Removable USB-Stick, running on *any* machine!  \n\nWith some advantages over the first.  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nThen I want to share my experiences about it...  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n**Applicability** :  \n\nMy method was born thinking about the following considerations.  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n**1.** The USB Flash Sticks are Removable devices.  \n\n**2.** The Removable devices always have one single Primary partition with the same size of the whole stick.  \n\n**3.** The booting from USB Removable devices is not too simply reachable, due to hardware-compatibility with BIOSes.  \n\n**4.** The vast majority of BIOSes strictly prefer, about the booting from USB Removable devices, the First Primary (Active) Partition in FAT file-system.  \n\n**5.** The FAT file-system has some limitations, at least in its maximum allowed size: 2.047,7 MB.  \n\n**6.** If a different file-system will be chosen for the first primary (active) partition then it will strongly reduce the BIOS/USB-Stick compatibility and then the capability to boot, with a lot of issues and a lot of artifices forcing to variously \"handle\" the Removable USB-Stick in order to make itself as \"bootable\".  \n\n**7.** The free open-source TrueCrypt (6.0a) System Partition Encryption often does not work at boot under XP on USB devices (both Removable and Fixed) if Windows is installed on the first primary (active) partition, and it seems that BestCrypt (shareware) does the same.  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nSo I thought that if I would have created on my Removable USB-Stick two partitions, the first one as a primary (active) partition in FAT and then the second one as an Extended partition with 1 (or more) Logical partition(s) inside, I would have been able to achieve the following advantages:  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n**1.** The highest level of compatibility BIOSes/USB-Sticks at booting, due to the fact that BIOSes would have always seen just a FAT partition as the first active partition.  \n\n**2.** The highest level of freedom in order to choose the preferred numbers (unlimited) of Logical Partitions (inside the Extended one).  \n\n**3.** The highest level of freedom in order to choose the preferred file-system for Logical partition (FAT32, NTFS) with any contraindications.  \n\n**4.** The highest level of freedom in order to choose the preferred partition size (the only possible limitation is due to Removable USB-Stick total size!).  \n\n**5.** The flawlessly Encryption of Logical System Partition, just where Windows resides (if wanted).  \n\n**6.** The flawlessly installation of Enhanced Write Filter RAM-REG Overlay (if wanted, but it is needed with NTFS on USB-Sticks).  \n\n**7.** And furthermore the Removable USB-Stick does NOT need ANY kind of intervention in order to make it as \"bootable\"!  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nWell, but on Removable USB Sticks it\u0027s not possible to create more than one single primary partition (large exactly as much as its maximum size) without at least some tweaks!  \n\nThis was true, but if you will use my method you will reach exactly the following: a Full (Generic) XP bootable on any machine and installed on a **Logical** (FAT32/NTFS) Partition of your Removable USB-Stick with the First Primary (Active) FAT Partition and with a Logical System Partition, **without touching your Removable USB-Stick** ! ![:whistling:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/happy22.gif)  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nSo, in order to reach the above described results you will need the following:  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n**1.** An USB Hard Disk\\* (that we will call \"Host-USB\" drive) and at least a Removable USB-Stick (that we will call \"Guest-USB\" drive).  \n\n**2.** A Windows XP installation CD-ROM created with [**NGINE**](http://www.ngine.de/article/id/8 \"External link\") method (I used XP SP3-Slipstreamed).  \n\n**3.** To partially follow Dietmar\u0027s Tutorials #3 and #6 (to make your XP-USB as XP-Generic, in order to properly boot from your USB-Stick on any machine) as described [here](http://www.boot-land.net/forums/?showtopic\u003d5315 \"External link\").  \n\n**4.** The Hitachi Microdrive Filter driver installation files.  \n\n**5.** The RAW image backup of your Guest-USB drive (then a related image backup software).  \n\n**6.** The Free Open-Source TrueCrypt 6.0a (as optional... AS OPTIONAL??? :wink: ).  \n\n**7.** EWF installation files (as optional, but needed if NTFS is on UFD!).  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n\\*Really it could be also an USB-Stick as physical Fixed Disk; so, in order to physically transform an USB-Stick as Fixed Disk, it\u0027s needed to flip its Removable Media Bit ( [http://www.911cd.net...showtopic\u003d21850](http://www.911cd.net/forums//index.php?showtopic\u003d21850 \"External link\") ) that is to TRY with Lexar BooIt software: if it works, ok; if it does not work, then you need an USB Hard Disk. However, I recently purchased for $ 40,00 a LaCie USB device that in an external size of a Credit Card contains an USB Fixed Disk 8 GB.  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n**Conclusions** (about Partitions Visibility):  \n\nPlease, think about the following: if and when you will see ALL partitions of your Removable USB-Stick this means that it has been \"transformed\" into a Fixed Disk (but remember that it happens from software-side, because you have NOT touched at all your Removable USB-Stick!), then this means that you\u0027ve booted from your Removable USB-Stick or that you\u0027ve installed Hitachi Microdrive also on the host machine!  \n\nOtherwise, if you will see only the first FAT primary (active) partition this means that you\u0027ve connected on any host machine your Removable USB-Stick not for booting, but just as a simple Removable USB-Stick.  \n\nSo if you want to use your Removable USB-Stick for shared file opearations too, then the advisable better way is to create the First Primary (Active) FAT Partition not too small, but in the largest possible size about your needs: however it will cannot be larger than 2.047,7 MB (a still respectable size to share your files!).  \n\nOtherwise, if you \"strictly\" want to share the whole size of your USB-Stick on any machine, the only way is to use the same \"microdrive\" folder that resides on your Removable USB-Stick (in \"\\\\WINDOWS\\\\system32\\\\drivers\\\\\") in order to install itself on any host machine where you \"strictly\" need!  \n\nOn the other hand if your System Partition is Encrypted (and about your data privacy it would must be just that!) then the other partitions rather than the Firts Primary (Active) FAT Partition will result not visible on any other machine, at any rate!  \n\nIn short, then you can use the first primary (active) FAT partition as your Trusted Zone, and the Logical Partition(s) as your Restricted (Encrypted) Zone!  \n\nFurthermore, if you must just share \"something\" that is in your Restricted (Encrypted) Zone then a simple booting from your Removable USB-Stick itself will be enough in order to gain the access to all what you own in that Zone and that you can easily copy into your Trusted Zone: much more time to describe it that to do it!  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nGreetings to all! :wink:   \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nBtw1: please, note that all what I\u0027ve described above is obviously valid for USB Hard Disks too!  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nBtw2: I just wonder if my method could be useful in PE environments too, but actually I\u0027m no longer too applied in PEs; so, if some dude would try it under his PE environment and then would report any kind of results then it could be a nice thing... :wink:  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n[![Posted Image](http://img142.imageshack.us/img142/8585/23766171ut9.th.png)](http://img142.imageshack.us/my.php?image\u003d23766171ut9.png \"External link\")  \nPeak Xtreme2 200X 32 GB **Removable** USB-Stick Encrypted  \n\n[![Posted Image](http://img381.imageshack.us/img381/2379/36602091ob1.th.png)](http://img381.imageshack.us/my.php?image\u003d36602091ob1.png \"External link\")  \nPeak Xtreme2 200X 32 GB Removable USB-Stick Encrypted EWF-Protected **booted** on 1st machine  \n\n[![Posted Image](http://img381.imageshack.us/img381/8360/57614578ld0.th.png)](http://img381.imageshack.us/my.php?image\u003d57614578ld0.png \"External link\")  \nPeak Xtreme2 200X 32 GB Removable USB-Stick Encrypted EWF-Protected **booted** on 2nd machine   \n"

      "content": "**Full (Generic) XP SP3-Slipstreamed on USB Removable (Encrypted) Logical Drive (EWF)**   \n\nHi, all!  \nReally I think that would be needed some further summarized informations, so I\u0027ve regrouped all the steps in the following  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n**Quick Start Notes**   \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n**1.** Under your IDE XP: connect your Host-USB (Fixed Disk), delete all partitions that it possibly contains and re-partition it as follows:  \n\nthe First Primary partition in FAT of your needed size (max size: 2.047,3 MB) and make it as Active; then create an Extended partition of your needed size (for example, in my case now it is 6.000 MB, and I created into it 2 Logical Drives); then create 1 (or more) Logical Partition(s) inside it, in FAT32 or NTFS file-system.  \n\nPlease, note that you have to format the above partitions NOT in Quick mode.  \n\nFurthermore, please consider that I noticed also that **if** TrueCrypt Boot Loader (or possibly other ones) was previously installed for any reason on your Host-USB, then it could continue to reside in the MBR of your Host-USB also after the (re)partitioning \\\u0026 (re)formatting.  \nSo, in order to reach a **reproducible** way with ANY strange issues I suggest you to replace the MBR of your Host-USB with a XP standard one or with a \"NotInitialized\" one before the partitioning.  \nAfter you\u0027ve replaced it with a \"NotInitialized\" one (with HDHacker [http://dimio.altervista.org/eng/](http://dimio.altervista.org/eng/ \"External link\") ), then please reboot your machine under your IDE XP and open Disk Management.  \nAt this point Disk Management will show the \"Welcome to the Initialize and Convert Disk Wizard\" window: then you will do as follows: click on \"Next \\\u003e Select disk to initialize (that will be already selected!) \\\u003e Next \\\u003e Finish\".  \nNow your Host-USB will have a \"new\" XP standard MBR!  \nThen you will can *safely* partition your Host-USB as described above!  \nOtherwise, if you are **sure** that your Host-USB already have a **clean** standard XP MBR, then you can directly partition it (but, please, you have to be sure!).  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n**2.** Insert **NGINE** XP CD-ROM, turn-off your machine and disconnect all other IDE Hard Disks, but not your Host-USB (just pre-partitioned).  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n**3.** Now turn-on your machine and boot from your CD-ROM, then install XP on the **second** partition of your Host-USB, that\u0027s just a **Logical** partition!  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n**4.** Complete the installation and reach your desktop.  \nPlease, note that during and after the complete installation, for only two-three times before to reach your Desktop you will must wait for 2-3 mins on a blank screen (!): so, please do not exit from your installation thinking something was gone wrong!  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n**5.** Disable all these: Paging File, System Restore and \"Automatically restart (at System Failure)\".  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n**6.** Turn-off your machine, connect your IDE Hard Disk(s) and boot from your IDE XP (let your Host-USB connected).  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n**7.** Follow related notes in order to reach a \"XP Generic after NGINE install\" ([here](http://www.boot-land.net/forums/?showtopic\u003d5315 \"External link\") or [here](http://www.911cd.net/forums//index.php?showtopic\u003d21711\u0026view\u003dfindpost\u0026p\u003d148627 \"External link\")).  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n**8.** Then boot from your Host-USB (with any IDE Hard Disk(s) connected) and follow again the above linked notes in order to update some drivers with the standard ones: now, you finally have your Host-USB in which a Full Generic XP is installed on a **Logical** partition.  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n**9.** Turn-off your machine, connect your IDE Hard Disk(s) and boot from your Host-USB again. Then copy \"microdrive\" unzipped (direct download [http://www.xpefiles....rvr1224_320.zip](http://www.xpefiles.com//files/xpfildrvr1224_320.zip \"External link\") ) folder (6 files - 20 kb) on your Host-USB in \"\\\\WINDOWS\\\\system32\\\\drivers\\\\\".  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n**10.** Connect your Guest-USB (that\u0027s your **Removable** USB-Stick) with no data inside.  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n**11.** Edit \"cfadisk.inf\" as follows: Device Manager \\\u003e Disk drives \\\u003e Select your Removable USB-Stick \\\u003e Select Details flag \\\u003e Select \"Hardware IDs\" \\\u003e Select and copy (CTRL+C) the FIRST related line.  \nThen paste this line in \"cfadisk.inf\" as follows:  \n\n*\\[cfadisk_device\\]\n%Microdrive_devdesc% \u003d cfadisk_install,**PasteTheLineHere***   \n\nPlease, note that if you wanted to use ANY your Removable USB-Stick for this purpose in order to simplify your job you can repeat the above procedure for ALL your Removable USB-Sticks (if wanted), so that your \"cfadisk.inf\" file will appear with something like the following inside:  \n\n```\n\u0026#91;cfadisk_device\u0026#93;\n\n%Microdrive_devdesc% \u003d cfadisk_install,USBSTOR\\DiskJetFlashTS2GJFV30_______8.07\n\n%Microdrive_devdesc% \u003d cfadisk_install,USBSTOR\\DiskPEAK_II_Flash_Drive_____0.00\n\n%Microdrive_devdesc% \u003d cfadisk_install,USBSTOR\\DiskPEAK_II_Flash_Drive_____1100\n\n%Microdrive_devdesc% \u003d cfadisk_install,USBSTOR\\DiskPhilips_USB_Flash_Drive_1100\n\n%Microdrive_devdesc% \u003d cfadisk_install,USBSTOR\\DiskJetFlashTS2GJFV10_______8.07\n```\n\nSo will be easiest to install Hitachi Microdrive also for ALL your Removable USB-Sticks.  \nReally you can do that in a single step: at first editing \"cfadisk.inf\" and including ALL entries related to ALL your Removable USB-Sticks, and then installing Hitachi Microdrive for all your Removable USB-Sticks in a single step, one at a time.  \n\nAfter that (and after all notes followed), you will can create a RAW image backup of your Guest-USB that will contains the Hitachi Microdrive Filter driver already installed for ALL your Removable USB-Sticks and then the same RAW image backup will can be restored and it will work on ALL your Removable USB-Sticks **with any your further intervention** !  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n**12.** In Device Manager (\\\u003e Disk drives) select your Guest-USB and update its driver with \"Hitachi Microdrive Filter driver\": Driver \\\u003e Update Driver... \\\u003e Install from a list or specific location (Advanced) \\\u003e Don\u0027t search. I will choose the driver to install. \\\u003e Have Disk... \\\u003e Browse... \\\u003e Select \"cfadisk.inf\" existing (and pre-edited!) in \"\\\\WINDOWS\\\\system32\\\\drivers\\\\microdrive\\\\\" \\\u003e OK \\\u003e Select \"Hitachi Microdrive\" in \"Model\" pane \\\u003e Next \\\u003e \"Update Driver (Compatibility) Warning\" window \\\u003e YES \\\u003e Finish \\\u003e Reboot now.  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n**13.** Repeat the Hitachi Microdrive Filter driver installation for all your Removable USB-Sticks (if wanted).  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n**14.** After the reboot(s) you will be again on your Host-USB desktop, so turn-off your machine and disconnect both your Host-USB and Guest-USB.  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n**15.** Shutdown Windows and then boot from your IDE XP: now insert your Guest-USB (Removable USB-Stick) and let Windows both to recognizes and to install it, then in Device Manager update its standard driver with Hitachi Microdrive Filter driver (\\\u003e Reboot now).  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n**16.** After the complete reboot: shutdown Windows, remove your Guest-USB and boot from your IDE XP again.  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n**17.** Create a standard image backup of your Host-USB (optional, because then you can simply do the copy of all needed files \\\u0026 folders from your Host-USB to your Guest-USB).  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n**18.** Always under your IDE XP insert your Guest-USB and both partition and format it (NOT in Quick mode) just like your Host-USB is, and make as Active the first FAT partition.  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n**19.** Restore the previously created standard image backup of your Host-USB on your Guest-USB (or simply copy all files \\\u0026 folders from your Host-USB partitions to your Guest-USB respective ones).  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n**20.** Shutdown Windows and boot from your Guest-USB in order to verify that all is going right.  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n**21.** Then shutdown Windows and boot from your IDE XP again.  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n**22.** Now create a RAW image backup of the whole your Guest-USB disk.  \n\nFrom this moment you could also *forget* your Host-USB!  \n\nIn the future if you want to add a new Removable USB-Stick to your XP-USB installation then you can do that under your just updated Guest-USB: so you will get an always updated RAW image backup of your Guest-USB that you can restore on any your Removable USB-Stick without both to install Hitachi Microdrive Filter and to partition it.  \n\nReally the RAW image backup of the whole disk is needed only if your Guest-USB have been already encrypted, but at any rate to use it allows the advantage to restore it on any Removable USB-Stick without the need to partition it (and then without the need to install Hitachi Microdrive Filter).  \n\nPlease, note that:  \n\n**a.** The Hitachi Microdrive Filter driver installation under your IDE XP (and the consequent partitioning of your Removable USB-Stick) is needed only **one** time and only for the **first** your Removable USB-Stick.  \n\n**b.** A RAW image backup of the whole your Guest-USB disk can be restored on ANY further Removable USB-Stick with any further action (so, no Hitachi Microdrive Filter and no partitioning).  \n\n**c.** A standard image backup of your Guest-USB can be restored only if your Removable USB-Stick is partitioned, that\u0027s only if Hitachi Microdrive Filter have been installed.  \n\nSo you can choose between two alternatives:  \n**\\*** to use a RAW image backup of the whole your Guest-USB disk although your Guest-USB\u0027s system partition is not encrypted: the image backup size will result larger, but then it does not need ANY further action in order to restore itself on ANY your new Removable USB-Stick;  \n**\\*** to use a standard image backup (but it is possible only if your Guest-USB\u0027s system partition is NOT encrypted) and then under your IDE XP to install Hitachi Microdrive Filter for any new Removable USB-Stick in order to partition it: the image backup size will result smaller, but then you must under your IDE XP both to install the Hitachi Microdrive Filter for any your new Removable USB-Stick and to partition it.  \nAt all events, easier to do rather than to describe!  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n**23.** Now you can restore your RAW image backup just created on (any) your new Guest-USB (Removable USB-Stick) with ANY further action (no Hitachi Microdrive Filter install and no partitioning).  \n\nPlease, note that obviously your (any) new Removable USB-Stick must be large in size enough in order to \"contain\" the RAW image backup of your Guest-USB!  \nIn other words, when you create the needed partitions of your Host-USB before the NGINE CD-ROM install you must have in mind that then the resulting RAW image backup will have the SAME total size of the whole Guest-USB disk.  \nFor example: on my Host-USB I\u0027ve created the First Primary (Active) partiton in FAT \u003d 1500 MB. Then I\u0027ve created an Extended partition \u003d 6000 MB. Then I\u0027ve created two Logical Drives inside it \u003d 4500 MB \\\u0026 1500 MB.  \nNow, when I will create a RAW image backup of the whole Guest-USB disk then the RAW image backup itself will result of a size equal to the sum of all previously created partition, that is: 1500 + 4500 + 1500 \u003d **7500 MB** (the possible remaining unallocated space is not relevant in order to can restore the image backup on other devices, but it is important when you create the RAW image backup).  \nIt\u0027s clear that then you will cannot restore that RAW image backup on any device that is **smaller** of 7500 MB in size! ![:whistling:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/happy22.gif)   \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n**24.** Done!  \nNow you can boot from your (any) **Removable USB-Stick** your Full (Generic) XP on USB **Logical** (Encrypted) Drive **with the highest level of success at booting under any BIOS(es)** , in your preferred file-system, on *any* machine, **without having *touched* your new Removable USB-Stick** ! :wink:   \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nIf needed you can use TrueCrypt (6.0a) in order to encrypt your System partiton (that is a Logical partition) when you want, then you will can re-create an actual RAW image backup that will be capable to be restored (TrueCrypt Boot Loader and Volume Header included) and to work on ALL your removable USB-Sticks with ANY your further intervention.  \n\nPlease note that you have to encrypt the System Logical Partition only (just where Windows resides), so the First Primary (Active) FAT partition, that contains only Windows boot files (7 hidden files - 320 kb), will remain not-encrypted (we called it as a \"Trusted Zone\") and then it will can be also useful regarding your file opearations and/or sharing.  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nEnjoy! :wink:   \n"

And on what drive Windows Page File is going to be created?\nYES/NO this is for \"FULL XP\", it will work EXACTLY as an XP on your internal disk.  \nIf you want to make it \"universal\" (which is a big word, let\u0027s say more portable) you need to add drivers and use a few other tricks, see above.  \nMore generally the idea about experimental builds is to ***experiment*** :wink:, noone will ever give you \"certainties\" about this and that, you try it and if it doesn\u0027t behave as you wish, you introduce some changes or use another trick or two.  \n\n\u003e Summarizing, how to maintain intact the original installed XP on the flash, and also extend the thumb service life by saving all local changes, required when booting on various config PCs, onto a virtual drive created at boot from the flash on a local hard drive or where you want it?\nThat\u0027s your theoretical idea of how this should work, and the answer is of course that of using a ramdisk build (read as firadisk or winvblock) but then you will have problems with it\u0027s size, and available RAM, etc.  \nIt is possible to create \"mixed builds\" where a \"core\" goes to ramdisk and \"all the rest\" goes to HD-like device, but it doesn\u0027t work this way, I mean you are asking very basic questions on very advanced topics, you need to approach this kind of things with baby steps, no way you will ever be capable of bulding from scratch a system \"exactly\" as you plan it without having tested the available options,   \n\n\u003e Another issue, not addressed here is creating a multiboot Flash. How is it possible using this method? For example, one may want to install XP on one partition, and a specific PC service disk image or Win 7 on another logical partition of the same thumb. Is that possible - how?\nIt is not addressed here as it is a non-question, once you have a USB hard disk device (or a USB stick seen as \"fixed\") and you know how to install a single OS in it and you know how to install normally a multiboot sytem on an internal hard disk, you will be able to do it.  \n\n\u003e As a side question, can you give a link to a good Survey \\\u0026 Wiki Article that briefly reviews all available methods and tools to create a multi-bootable USB Thumb with OS install option from it, or add an OS image to a bootable Thumb, and compares their strong and weak points, and most suitable usage scenarios for each thumb type. In short, a bird view of current state of the whole \"Boot from flash\" matter.\nNO. :smile:  \nBOTH because of this:  \n[http://homepages.tes...no-answers.html](http://homepages.tesco.net/J.deBoynePollard/FGA/questions-with-yes-or-no-answers.html \"External link\")  \nand because AFAIK such a beautiful thing like you depicted doesn\u0027t exist AFAIK.  \n\nReally, don\u0027t take it the wrong way, but your set of questions sounds a lot like (using one of my carpenter\u0027s comparisons :wink:):  \n\n* How can I build a house?\n* Is it better in stone, bricks or wood?\n* Will the basement be dry or there is a risk of humidity?\n* Is there a complete set of instructions for each and a detailed comparison of all the pros and cons of each?\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nFor most of which there simply no \"straight\" answers and definitely, even when there are, they are not \"easy\".  \n\nTake \"baby steps\", learn to walk before attempting running. ![:ph34r:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/scared9.gif)  \n\n![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif)  \nWonko   \n"
