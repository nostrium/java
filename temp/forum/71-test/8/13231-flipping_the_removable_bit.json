      "content": "Almost off topic but,  \nI use an app by \"Lexar\" that flips the \"removable bit\" on Lexar and a few other brands (not all) of flash drives. For the brands that the app didn\u0027t work on, i have lost, but used to have a \"script\"? written in notepad that when placed in your registry would tell Windows that this particular flash drive was not removable and that allowed Windows to recognize, format and access multiple partitions on a removable flash drive. does anyone know of the script or notepad file i\u0027m speaking of?   \n\nmany thanks,  \nMichael Clyde   \n"

      "content": "**How to use the \"Hitachi Microdrive Filter Driver \" for USB Flash Drive (UFD) partitioning**  \n\n1. Download Driver Package from [here](http://www.uwe-sieber.de/files/xpfildrvr1224_320.zip \"External link\").  \n\n2. Extract **cfadisk.inf** and **cfadisk.sys** to a folder on your UFD (1st primary partition automatically). Just to have it available, when you need it on other systems !  \n\n3. Open **cfadisk.inf** with an Editor.  \n\n4. Look for lines ...  \n\n```\n...\n\n\u0026#91;cfadisk_device\u0026#93;\n\n%Microdrive_devdesc% \u003d cfadisk_install,...\n\n%Microdrive_devdesc% \u003d cfadisk_install,...\n\n...\n\n\u0026#91;cfadisk_addreg\u0026#93;\n\n...\n```\n\n... and **replace** it by  \n\n```\n...\n\n\u0026#91;cfadisk_device\u0026#93;\n\n%Microdrive_devdesc% \u003d cfadisk_install,USBSTOR\\GenDisk\n\n\n\n\u0026#91;cfadisk_addreg\u0026#93;\n\n...\n```\n\nLeave only this (ONE) line under the item **cfadisk_device** , delete the rest up to the empty line preceeding **cfadisk_addreg** (both excluded, of course). There is no need to alter anything else.  \n\n5. In Windows start \"Device Management\" (devmgmt.msc), open \"Disks\", right click your UFD and \"actualize\" the driver. It\u0027s not found automatically; you have to point the wizard to your UFD (where it should be according to item 2). When you see \"Hitachi Microdrive\" as selection, choose it and proceed. Ignore the usual warning.  \n\n6. There is no need to reboot. Just go to \"Disk management\" (diskmgmt.msc) and  \npartition your UFD for your needs.   \n\n**Edited by COD11, 04 December 2010 - 05:36 PM.**\n"
