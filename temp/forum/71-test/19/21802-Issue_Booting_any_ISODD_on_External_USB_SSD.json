      "content": "Hey I am having an issue trying to Boot an Image/any image in this matter with Rufus onto my external USB SSD T5. When I boot up my PC from USB using Bios I get this error \"Selected boot device not available\".\n\nI have succefully Booted a different USB Device using the same Image on (DD Mode). I have also tested the SSD T5 on a different computer using the same method and it boots up no problem so its only this computer that it doesnt boot from.\n\nIt is acting like my Bios doesnt want to recognize this Drive for some reason (on Boot only) or rufus is possibly putting the Image on at a different location then my Other USB Device and bios cant find it.\n\nI have the latest Bios Version and have also re-installed it to make sure it wasnt corrupt or anything. I noticed when I Connected the SSD T5 to my computer it is reading it as a \"Disk Drive\" instead of \"Removable disk drive\" so I dont know if this has anything to do with it.\n\nCurrent Bios Settings:\n\nBoot Sequence Order: **1.** USB Device **2.** Onboard or USB Floppy Drive **3.** Onboard or USB CD-ROM Drive **4.** 01D00 LUNOATA SAMSUNG SSD\n\nSAS Controller: Enabled\n\nDiskette Drive: USB\n\nSATA Operation: AHCI\n\nSMART Reporting: Enabled\n\nUSB Controller: Enabled\n\nFastBoot: Disabled\n\nSamsung Portable SSD T5 USB Device (SSD)  \nManufacturer SAMSUNG  \nHeads 16  \nCylinders 121,601  \nTracks 31,008,255  \nSectors 1,953,520,065  \nSATA type SATA-III 6.0Gb/s  \nDevice type Fixed  \nATA Standard ACS2  \nSerial Number S3USNK0JA00631W  \nFirmware Version Number MVT41P1Q  \nLBA Size 48-bit LBA  \nPower On Count 254 times  \nPower On Time 16.8 days  \nSpeed Not used (SSD Drive)  \nFeatures S.M.A.R.T., NCQ, TRIM, SSD  \nMax.

I cant even boot a windows 7 install disc from USB from the T5 on the Dell Precision T7500 but works fine on a MSI WT70 Laptop (Windows 7) using the T5. The Bios is newer on the WT70 so I am guessing this has something to do with it.\n\n"
