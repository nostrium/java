      "content": "You aren\u0027t likely to get help with Android-related issues here, this forum is primarily focused on booting methods as they relate to Windows, and other PC OSes to a much lesser extent. You would be much better off reporting such problems to the app developer so they can maybe address it. For Android issues the XDA forums is the go-to spot for me.   \n"
