      "content": "Hi there,\n\nI been scratching my head to get a working XP usb OS to work with the tutorials here since 3 days. Unfortunately there are so many different approaches only on this site and are really hard to follow. Some apps mentioned aren\u0027t available anymore f.e. VHD_format.\n\nAt the end I used[this tutorial](https://www.alychidesigns.com/create-windows-xp-install-usb/ \"External link\")which made me boot to Grub4dos and select XP. BUT I get an Stop Error \"**0x000000A5 The bios in this system is not fully ACPI compliant**\" after selecting the VHD image. The XP iso was included with SATA driver already. My board is an x370 Crosshair Hero VI with the latest bios. Searching the net I was not lucky finding the reason for the error. I was disabling/enabling ACPI related bios option with no success. Is an AM4 able to boot XP anyway?\n\nI\u0027m curious that no one came to the idea to upload a ready-to-use USB image. USB image tool makes bootable images of usb drives. **If anyone is willing to share the ready-to-use image of the XP USB device I would be really happy as I don\u0027t have any ideas anymore?**\n\n**Edited by tarsonis, 20 May 2019 - 02:02 PM.**\n"

      "content": "Thanks. At least it sounds a modified XP works on modern chipsets but they speak about the intel chipsets and a lot of stuff I don\u0027t understand. Hope someone have a modified XP iso that would work in this case or \"fingers cross\" a ready-to-use USB image that I can put on usb. Otherwise I fear I have to cancel this project bc its doesnt work for me here. ![:(](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/sad.png)\n\n"

XP is still a licensed OS and it is still illegal to provide downloads of it or use it without a licence.\n\nMaybe there is another way to achieve what you want to do?\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks. I ran a dual boot on my older Z77 chipset with Win7/Xp for years. This was my workstation with a UAD DSP card and projects/plugins that were running only on XP. I still have this XP OS on my separate HDD but it won\u0027t start. Always this stupid Stop A5 or 7b error. The same goes for my 3 day research USB Xp versions I tried attempts. My head is cooking and I\u0027m nearly off to throw this computer out of the window. I need to get some older project to open which are on this XP.. I didn\u0027t imaging this is such a miracle to install an old OS\n\nFor all I information I gathered I\u0027m missing this AHCI driver as my motherboard AM4 doesnt have any compatible Sata mode which suck a lot. I regret I didn\u0027t know this before buying into AM4... I should slipstreame this driver in the XP setup. But I tried now two AHCI driver on the net with the same BSODs. Asus doesnt offern any 32bit chipset drivers for my board and I have no clue which AHCI driver could work. Massive time consuming, always generate a new XP iso and generate an USB disc.\n\n**Edited by tarsonis, 21 May 2019 - 01:27 PM.**\n"

      "content": "OK - so XP does not natively support booting from a USB drive. So I would advise you to experiment by installing to an internal disk.\n\nThe disk needs to be as old school as possible, so not nvme! Use SATA and if possible, try to disable any BIOS settings for it (no RAID, use AHCI - I doubt if it will have a legacy option, etc.).\n\nNext you need to look for a way of adding suitable XP drivers for your SATA chipset into the XP install files - this is probably where it all falls down because there probably aren\u0027t any!\n\nEven if you managed to find a suitable mass storage driver, I suspect there may be other driver issues for anything else you want to connect.\n\nWould it be possible to run XP in a Virtual Machine to get your older project open?\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks for your response. Sorry my fault. I forgot to tell I already hooked up an old sata drive (connected with sata) and my dvd drive (my old XP setup cd) with the same BSOD while setup preparation. Also I did try the VM solution first but PCI passthrough is the next big miracle for me I gave up on. With VM I cant use the DSP card, so can\u0027t open the projects. I tried so many various solutions I lost the track. My first initial wish was to have my old XP OS cloned to a bootable USB and start it up if I need files from my old projects. Now I ended up not even able to use XP on this machine it seems.\n\n**Edited by tarsonis, 21 May 2019 - 01:46 PM.**\n"
