      "content": "So, my advanced startup shows \"Use Devices\" option which shows me 2 further options to boot from EFI USB, EFI DVD and EFI Network. I am using Windows 10 1809, october build or pre January 2019 build. These options are available to me with/without the usb plugged in. In bootice, in the uefi entries section, I can further see these options.  \n\nAlthough, I can\u0027t see them in the boot menu unless I plug in the usb. At which point it shows and boots to usb. That\u0027s the conventional method to booting to usb.  \n\nBut with with that \"Use Devices\" option in advanced startup, I can directly boot to usb from within windows. I can also do so via bootice, and selecting the tick mark to \"Boot this entry next time\" option at which it directly boots to my usb.   \n\nI have two questions, I can see it in my laptop, but was trying to reproduce in other laptop too unsuccessfully. I didn\u0027t had to do anything in this one, and idk how they are enabled already. I want to know how can I manually add such entry through bootice/easybcd if possible. The second question is, can I change uefi entries from cmd, or more or less, at least be able to tick that box \"Boot this entry next time\" through cmd and save it up?\n\n[https://ibb.co/Y3p9DnM](https://ibb.co/Y3p9DnM \"External link\")\n\n(Sorry, it told me that I couldn\u0027t post image with that extension in this forum.)\n\n**Edited by Raex, 12 April 2019 - 05:31 AM.**\n"

      "content": "\u003e Yep :smile:, it is not like \\*everyone\\* knows these tricks, but they can come handy :wink: .  \n\u003e\n\u003e What I find \"curious\" (but maybe it is perfectly \"normal\", cannot say) is that seemingly - according to the timestamps of the GUID\u0027s - the order in which those entries were created was:  \n\u003e 1) EFI USB Device  \n\u003e 2) EFI DVD/CDROM  \n\u003e 3) EFI Network  \n\u003e 4) Actual installed windows  \n\u003e\n\u003e Since I doubt that the first three are part of the Windows install/setup, it is more likely that they were pre-existing in NVRAM (as if they are created by the UEFI, independently from any Windows insatall and before it) and the Windows install simply enumerated them before adding/creating its own entry. ![:unsure:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/unsure.png)  \n\u003e\n\u003e ![:duff:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/duff.gif)  \n\u003e Wonko\n\nI have acer v5 122p netbook and for me I haven\u0027t had such troubles before. These entries are the result that it automatically has entries to boot to uefi enabled devices unlike Dell\u0027s laptops for which uefi booting is only allowed to windows boot manager, originally when the windows is installed on it. The bios automatically picks up uefi enabled devices when one is plugged into it but it never shows you an entry for it otherwise.  \n\nI came upon some articles and I think I might have found how to add them, although I knew about that technique before but I thought maybe the bios would have default settings for uefi devices, but unfortunately it didn\u0027t. The trick to adding it to the firmware boot manager is to have a uefi enabled device plugged into the laptop (a USB or a CD/DVD) and then add that entry to the firmware boot manager whereby it\u0027ll permanently add an entry to boot to a uefi enabled device whether it is the same usb or a different one. Still have to try it on, but I\u0027m pretty sure this method would work.  \n\nEdit: I should say that in legacy mode, dell gives option to boot to devices by default unlike in uefi mode. So it\u0027s dell\u0027s own problem which they have created by themselves. And by default, if bios allows it windows will have these entries in advanced startup whereby they might get copied into the bcd too. Also, yes bootice allows you to boot to a usb I\u0027ve done so many times on my laptop.\n\n**Edited by Raex, 14 April 2019 - 07:06 PM.**\n"
