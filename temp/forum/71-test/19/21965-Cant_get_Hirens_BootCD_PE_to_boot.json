I would still like to get Hiren to work, I\u0027m finding more and more it would be useful for me.\n\nI have an older laptop running a BIOS system, and I was actually able to get the Hiren\u0027s PE to load up through USB on it, so the image and thumbdrive work.\n\nWhen I tried again on my current system I noticed there are 2 options to boot from the thumbdrive, UEFI \\\u0026 USB.\n\nWhen I try the UEFI that\u0027s when it get\u0027s stuck on the Asrock logo.\n\nWhen I try the USB option I will get the Windows logo, but it won\u0027t go any further. There\u0027s no circular loading logo.\n\nHow does Windows PE work? Does it use the local drive for temp files, or does it keep everything on the thumbdrive, or does it keep everything in RAM? I don\u0027t know if it makes a difference, but the system drive on my computer is formated with MBR.\n\nNot sure what you are suggesting with RMPrepUSB, is it a Rufus equivalent?\n\n"

The current HirensPE has a 1.3GB boot.wim file, so I suspect you will need a system with at least 2GB of RAM if not more?\n\nDoes the AsRock system have a 64-bit UEFI BIOS or a 32-bit UEFI BIOS? HBCDPE only boots on 64-bit UEFI systems and the file must be on a FAT partition.\n\n"

I can\u0027t find the spec anywhere, but I\u0027m going to assume the Taichi x399 has a 64-bit UEFI since Threadripper is an HEDT system.  \nI tried one more time creating a bootable USB with Rufus first using MBR/NTFS and also GPT/FAT. I tried loading it with CSM-on and CSM-off loading UEFI and USB.  \nThe best I can get is booting the MBR/NTFS version, it will show the Windows logo and the USB drive light will show activity, but after a few minutes it will stop blinking and the system just sits there. The circular loading logo never appears.  \nWhen I boot with the GPT/FAT version it freezes on the Asrock logo.\n\n**Edited by billbill, 15 March 2019 - 01:02 AM.**\n"
