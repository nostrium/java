Now, this problem is gone.\n\nI never thought, that everybody can program its own Ven_DEV_ number in its xhci.sys file.\n\nBut exact this happens. Last (small) problem was, that usbstor.sys was not loaded,\n\nwhich I can see at Vid\\\u0026Pid 0000 0000.\n\nThen I come to the idea, that for some crazy reasons they rename usbstor.sys to amdstor.sys.\n\nIt is not enough just to rename those files, you also have to rename its whole surrounding.\n\nAnd I can see, that at every place usbstor \u003d\\\u003e amdstor, this I just reverted.\n\nUSB kill has been done for mouse, keyboard, sticks, harddisks, just crazy all.\n\n"
