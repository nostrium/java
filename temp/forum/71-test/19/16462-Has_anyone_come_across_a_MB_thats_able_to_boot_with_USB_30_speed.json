And even if you can boot from it, there might be issues like initialising at low USB1.1 speeds.  \nAdd to that that there aren\u0027t many reviews about USB3.0 practical transfer speeds, and if they\u0027re present then the controller and/or boot medium is flawed.  \nWhat\u0027s needed is a fast SSD connected to USB3.0 to verify transfer speeds. Ideally some kind of hardware RAMDISK though. USB sticks are often quite limited in sequential and random speeds.  \n\nIs there any review showing a full Windows 7 or Windows 8 booting from SSD/Thumbdrive connected to USB3.0? AMD A75 appears having bootable USB3.0, onboard Asmedia also seems bootable, next up is Intel\u0027s Z77 chipset :smile:   \n"

All the dozens of new Dells that I have gotten with USB 3.1 ports will boot fine to any bootable USB device, they especially boot fast with a USB 3.1 pen drive. One caveat that is true for any USB boot, be sure USB booting is turned ON in the BIOS, and make sure secure boot is OFF and legacy boot turned ON.\n\nMy Sandisk Extreme Pro 3.1 boots and runs very quickly on everything new coming through the door nowadays.\n\n"
