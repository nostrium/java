      "content": "![DualPart.png](http://rra.az/ra/DualPart.png)  \nA portable GUI program for creating a bootable USB device with two partitions.  \nThis utility can work with the command line and this simplifies and speeds up the creation of a bootable USB.  \nAfter splitting into two parts, the program can automatically install the bootloader (2 for now) Grub4DOS and Windows NT 6x.  \nIf there are files with the names part1. \\* and part2. \\* the program will automatically unpack the data into the appropriate partition.  \nSupported file formats for unpacking \\[.iso, .rar, .zip, .7z\\]  \nDefault bootloader is Windows NT 6x.  \nThe default active partition is first.  \nPartition label must be in quotes in command line.  \n/ dr: Disk Number or Tom Letter  \n/ 1s: size of the first partition.  \n/ 1f: Format of the first partition.  \n/ 1l: Label of the first section.  \n/ 2s: size of the second section.  \n/ 2f: Format of the second section.  \n/ 2l: The label of the second section.  \n/ a: Active partition  \n/ bl: loader.  \n/ bf: bootloader file (Grub4DOS).  \n/ o: Path to the text file with the letters of the created sections. (output)  \n/ s: Quiet mode (no error and completion window will be displayed).  \nFormatting is automatically specified depending on the size of the created partition:  \n1. up to 32mb - FAT  \n2. up to 4GB - FAT32  \n3. from 4GB to NTFS  \nDisk number example:  \ndualpart.exe / dr: 1 / 1s: 16 / 1f: FAT / 1l: \"aa bb cc\" / 2f: NTFS / 2l: \"dd ee ff\" / bl: Grub4dos / bf: g2ldr / a: 1 / o: output.txt / s  \nExample with the letter of the section:  \ndualpart.exe / dr: F / 2s: 16 / 1f: NTFS / 1l: \"aa bb cc\" / 2f: NTFS / 2l: \"dd ee ff\" / bl: Grub4dos / bf: g2ldr / a: 1 / o: output.txt / s  \nMinimum command:  \ndualpart.exe / dr: 1 / 1s: 16  \n[Download DualPart](http://rra.az/ra/DualPart.zip \"External link\")\n\n**Edited by rradjab, 14 March 2019 - 07:43 AM.**\n"
