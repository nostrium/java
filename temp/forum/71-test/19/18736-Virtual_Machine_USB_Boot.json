This way it will prevent data loss and the changes made to the drive in the virtual machine will be visible in the host OS too.  \n\n![Posted Image](http://i57.tinypic.com/25j8utd.png)  \n\n**Requirements:**   \n\nHost OS: Windows XP/Vista/7/8/8.1  \nVirtualBox (installed not portable) and/or QEMU  \n\n**How you can use it:**   \n\nDownload and unzip the setup file or the portable version. Install the setup file and start it or just start the portable.  \nIf you have a limited user account on the host OS you need to start it as an administrator, because only this way it will properly check and use the real (USB) drive.  \nIn Windows 7/8/8.1 it will automatically start it as an administrator. In Windows XP and Vista it will have to be set manually:  \n\n![Posted Image](http://i58.tinypic.com/nnnqlc.png)  \n\nIf you intend to use the VirtualBox Manager in the same time with Virtual Machine USB Boot, I strongly suggest to set its exe file or shortcut to be started as an administrator too.  \n\n![Posted Image](http://i59.tinypic.com/wcbnll.png)  \n\nNow, in the main application\u0027s window, click on the Add button.  \nYou\u0027ll see this window:  \n\n![Posted Image](http://i62.tinypic.com/f3hqux.png)  \n\n![Posted Image](http://i59.tinypic.com/2zr2p7p.png)  \n\nHere you can set:  \n\n- the VM type (VirtualBox or QEMU);  \n- the name of the list entry;  \n- the way you can set the VirtualBox VM: by name, by path or by exe parameters;  \n- the drive to add and boot (usually a USB drive);  \n- a second drive (if you set \"Add second drive option\" in Options);  \n- for VirtualBox VMs: enable/disable/switch CPU virtualization;  \n- for QEMU VMs: memory size, a HDD image file, a CD/DVD device and a sound card;  \n- the state of the main window for VirtualBox/QEMU (minimized/normal/maximized/fullscreen/hidden);  \n- the CPU priority (BelowNormal/Normal/AboveNormal/High).  \n\nIf all is set you can click on Ok.  \n\nWhen you first use the application it\u0027s wise to set the options. So click on Options button.  \n\n![Posted Image](http://i61.tinypic.com/i736th.png)  \n\nHere you can set the wait time from the moment the application triggers the system data flush on the drive to the moment it actually dismounts it; usually 500 ms is enough but you can increase it on slower drive/OS/computer.  \nThe next option will set if the application will try to lock the volume(s) on the drive before dismounting it/them. This way you can be sure that all the system data was flushed and there are no processes accessing the drive. But sometimes it can be slow...  \nIf you wanna add a second drive to the virtual machine check the \"show a second drive option\".  \n\"Backup the old entries before saving the new ones\": it will save the old entries as \"Application_name.vml.bak\". Useful when you often have problems with the OS, the computer or electricity. If you don\u0027t have such problems you can uncheck it.  \n\"Don\u0027t warn when not able to save the configuration or the entries file\": you can uncheck it if you start VMUB from a read only medium or with 0% free space.  \nWhen you add a new entry, the VM type is VirtualBox by default but you can change it to QEMU if you like.  \nWith the next option only the USB drives are listed. If you uncheck it the internal HDDs (except the OS drive) and the mounted virtual HDDs will be listed too.  \nThe font size, name, style, color and script for the entries list can be changed to your liking.  \nBy default the Escape key pressed in the main window can close the entire application but now you can activate/deactivate it.  \nIn VirtualBox section, you can set the path to the VirtualBox exe (usually autodetected).  \nYou can choose the way the application will modify the VirtualBox machine:  \n- to try to autodetect the most appropriate for the given situation;  \n- calling VboxManage.exe a few times with specific parameters; this method is slow but you can keep VirtualBox Manager opened all the time if you want;  \n- modifying the virtual machine\u0027s configuration file (\\*.vbox) directly; it\u0027s faster but VirtualBox Manager must be closed; also, if you keep (re)starting the virtual machine very fast each time after you closed it then it will be a little less stable.  \nAlso you can set if the \"Enable VT-x/AMD-V\" option will be showed in the Add/Edit window and if the drive(s) should be removed when the VM is closed.  \nIn QEMU section, you can set the path to its exe (usually autodetected if QEMU was installed).  \nYou can set the default exe parameters that will appear in the Add window when you add a new QEMU entry.  \n\nIf all are set, click on the Start button and the virtual machine will be configured and started.  \n\n**Tips:**   \n\n1. When you first create the virtual machine in VirtualBox make sure there is a free port in the storage controller. This way the application will add the drive there.  \nAlso, if you want to boot from that drive, make sure the free port is positioned prior to other drives, because the VirtualBox VM will boot from the first drive in the storage controller(s).  \nYou can do that by starting the VirtualBox Manager, editing the VM\u0027s storage options and moving the other drive(s) into subsequent port(s).  \n2. Try to avoid using snapshots or saving state of the VM.  \n3. In the main window you can choose which columns you want to hide/show by right clicking on the columns and checking/uncheking them in the popup menu. Also you can modify their lengths.  \nYou can sort the entries by clicking on the header of each column.  \n4. The application will remember the position, the size and the maximized state of the main window. Also any column changes...  \n5. In the list you can right click on an entry and choose an action or use keyboard shortcuts (Insert, E, Return, +, Delete, Alt+Up, Alt+Down, Ctrl+P).  \n6. Usually it takes a few seconds to configure and load the VirtualBox VM but sometimes it will take a little longer, so don\u0027t be alarmed.  \n7. When you start the application or when you add or edit an entry, the application will generate a new ID/GUID for the drive. This is a unique number used internally in VirtualBox for identifying the drive.  \n8. The drive you choose in Add/Edit window will be later recognized and used even if you disconnect/connect other drives before using it again.  \n9. If you receive an warning or an error message from the application, please read the text thoroughly because it will help you solve the problem. The application is designed to deal and solve many problems but, like any computer program, it can\u0027t solve all of them. But I implemented helpful suggestions/informations in these messages so you can easily solve them.  \n10. Before saving the entries list (\\*.vml) the application will backup the previous file in \\*.vml.bak. If you made a change that you don\u0027t like or if the OS/computer malfunctioned and it did not properly saved the vml file then you can restore it by removing the .bak extension.  \nThese files are near the exe file in the portable version or in the \"C:\\\\Users\\\\UserName\\\\AppData\\\\Roaming\\\\Virtual Machine USB Boot folder\" (Windows Vista, 7, 8) in the installed version. In Windows XP they are in the \"C:\\\\Documents and Settings\\\\UserName\\\\Application Data\\\\Virtual Machine USB Boot\" folder. Normally these folders are hidden so you will need to unhide them or use a file manager set to see hidden files and folders.  \n11. The default exe parameters for QEMU are just a \"guideline/example\" on how to boot with QEMU x86/x64. But if you want to use/change other QEMU features you should add more parameters. Also, other QEMU versions may require additional parameters to boot. For example -kernel and -initrd.  \n12. QEMU usually shows 2 windows: one that displays text details about the VM and one with the VM. The \"Run\" option will change the state of the first window.  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n**Changes in 1.51 version:**   \n\n1. The scan for (USB) disks is faster.  \n2. In the Add/Edit window the information about found disks and CDROM drives is shown on columns (name/size/volume letter(s)).  \n3. A few bugs solved.  \n4. Some small improvements to the language code.  \n5. Added german translation (lng file) sent by [Blackcrack](http://reboot.pro/user/43143-blackcrack/ \"\").  \n\n[Click here to download this file](http://reboot.pro/files/file/339-virtual-machine-usb-boot/ \"\")   \n"

      "content": "\u003e Thanks DavidB! this tool is very useful. I dont understand why the VB devs can not make their program with this function?\n\nI noticed in the last years they are trying to make VB work only with OS\u0027s installed inside the VM. So using a real drive is obviously not preferred.\n\nThey have their reasons for doing this, maybe they\u0027re not 100% bad reasons, but I can\u0027t say because they are not talking about that.\n\nIt\u0027s their right not to talk, of course, but it\u0027s not \"open source\"...\n\nMy personal opinion is: at some point in the future VirtualBox may not be free and open source anymore...\n\n\u003e Does it work with portable VirtualBox also?\n\nIt may not work because the installed version has a specific folder to store the configuration file: C:\\\\Users\\\\UserName\\\\.VirtualBox.\n\nIf the portable version is not using the same folder my application has no way to find the path to the VMs, their names, configuration and so on...\n\nBtw, I\u0027m a big fan of portable versions for any program, but, when I tried a portable VirtualBox version some time ago, I wasn\u0027t too pleased.\n\n2 reasons:\n\n1. VirtualBox is already \"lite\" so using a portable version does not lower the resources usage.\n\n2. the portable version is kinda limited...\n\nBut I\u0027m willing to give it a try...\n\nJust send me a link to your version so I can test it and make the appropriate modifications to VMUB (if necessary)...\n\n"

The configuration file is indeed in another location: \"Portable-VirtualBox\\\\data\\\\.VirtualBox\". So I have to add a new edit box for this in Options. But that\u0027s not such a big problem...  \n2. It starts/closes much slower than the installed version, because in has to register/unregister some services. But VMUB already needs some time to configure and start the VM so this additional delay may be unacceptable for the user.  \n3. If Portable-VirtualBox.exe isn\u0027t loaded VirtualBox.exe and VboxManage.exe can\u0027t be used directly. So, VMUB has to start this exe, after a few seconds the VirtualBox Manager is opened, makes the modifications to the VM and starts it. But some users may not like that VBM must be opened each time.  \n\nMy opinion is most users won\u0027t like the additional delay and/or VBM must be opened.\n\n"

I even tried with a volume (//./d:) and with /dev/cdrom, still doesn\u0027t work.  \nIt seems that the problem could be somewhere in the Qemu code, since the error appears even when my program isn\u0027t used.  \n\nSo, for now, I advice you to use the older version.  \nAlso I think it\u0027s wise to test with a batch file first to be sure it will work.  \nYou say that you have an error. Could you please show me the parameters that you used...?\n\n"

This way it will prevent data loss and the changes made to the drive in the virtual machine will be visible in the host OS too.  \n\n![Posted Image](http://i57.tinypic.com/25j8utd.png)  \n\n**Requirements:**   \n\nHost OS: Windows XP/Vista/7/8/8.1  \nVirtualBox (installed not portable) and/or QEMU  \n\n**How you can use it:**   \n\nDownload and unzip the setup file or the portable version. Install the setup file and start it or just start the portable.  \nIf you have a limited user account on the host OS you need to start it as an administrator, because only this way it will properly check and use the real (USB) drive.  \nIn Windows 7/8/8.1 it will automatically start it as an administrator. In Windows XP and Vista it will have to be set manually:  \n\n![Posted Image](http://i58.tinypic.com/nnnqlc.png)  \n\nIf you intend to use the VirtualBox Manager in the same time with Virtual Machine USB Boot, I strongly suggest to set its exe file or shortcut to be started as an administrator too.  \n\n![Posted Image](http://i59.tinypic.com/wcbnll.png)  \n\nNow, in the main application\u0027s window, click on the Add button.  \nYou\u0027ll see this window:  \n\n![Posted Image](http://i62.tinypic.com/f3hqux.png)  \n\n![Posted Image](http://i59.tinypic.com/2zr2p7p.png)  \n\nHere you can set:  \n\n- the VM type (VirtualBox or QEMU);  \n- the name of the list entry;  \n- the way you can set the VirtualBox VM: by name, by path or by exe parameters;  \n- the drive to add and boot (usually a USB drive);  \n- a second drive (if you set \"Add second drive option\" in Options);  \n- for VirtualBox VMs: enable/disable/switch CPU virtualization;  \n- for QEMU VMs: memory size, a HDD image file, a CD/DVD device and a sound card;  \n- the state of the main window for VirtualBox/QEMU (minimized/normal/maximized/fullscreen/hidden);  \n- the CPU priority (BelowNormal/Normal/AboveNormal/High).  \n\nIf all is set you can click on Ok.  \n\nWhen you first use the application it\u0027s wise to set the options. So click on Options button.  \n\n![Posted Image](http://i61.tinypic.com/i736th.png)  \n\nHere you can set the wait time from the moment the application triggers the system data flush on the drive to the moment it actually dismounts it; usually 500 ms is enough but you can increase it on slower drive/OS/computer.  \nThe next option will set if the application will try to lock the volume(s) on the drive before dismounting it/them. This way you can be sure that all the system data was flushed and there are no processes accessing the drive. But sometimes it can be slow...  \nIf you wanna add a second drive to the virtual machine check the \"show a second drive option\".  \n\"Backup the old entries before saving the new ones\": it will save the old entries as \"Application_name.vml.bak\". Useful when you often have problems with the OS, the computer or electricity. If you don\u0027t have such problems you can uncheck it.  \n\"Don\u0027t warn when not able to save the configuration or the entries file\": you can uncheck it if you start VMUB from a read only medium or with 0% free space.  \nWhen you add a new entry, the VM type is VirtualBox by default but you can change it to QEMU if you like.  \nWith the next option only the USB drives are listed. If you uncheck it the internal HDDs (except the OS drive) and the mounted virtual HDDs will be listed too.  \nThe font size, name, style, color and script for the entries list can be changed to your liking.  \nBy default the Escape key pressed in the main window can close the entire application but now you can activate/deactivate it.  \nIn VirtualBox section, you can set the path to the VirtualBox exe (usually autodetected).  \nYou can choose the way the application will modify the VirtualBox machine:  \n- to try to autodetect the most appropriate for the given situation;  \n- calling VboxManage.exe a few times with specific parameters; this method is slow but you can keep VirtualBox Manager opened all the time if you want;  \n- modifying the virtual machine\u0027s configuration file (\\*.vbox) directly; it\u0027s faster but VirtualBox Manager must be closed; also, if you keep (re)starting the virtual machine very fast each time after you closed it then it will be a little less stable.  \nAlso you can set if the \"Enable VT-x/AMD-V\" option will be showed in the Add/Edit window and if the drive(s) should be removed when the VM is closed.  \nIn QEMU section, you can set the path to its exe (usually autodetected if QEMU was installed).  \nYou can set the default exe parameters that will appear in the Add window when you add a new QEMU entry.  \n\nIf all are set, click on the Start button and the virtual machine will be configured and started.  \n\n**Tips:**   \n\n1. When you first create the virtual machine in VirtualBox make sure there is a free port in the storage controller. This way the application will add the drive there.  \nAlso, if you want to boot from that drive, make sure the free port is positioned prior to other drives, because the VirtualBox VM will boot from the first drive in the storage controller(s).  \nYou can do that by starting the VirtualBox Manager, editing the VM\u0027s storage options and moving the other drive(s) into subsequent port(s).  \n2. Try to avoid using snapshots or saving state of the VM.  \n3. In the main window you can choose which columns you want to hide/show by right clicking on the columns and checking/uncheking them in the popup menu. Also you can modify their lengths.  \nYou can sort the entries by clicking on the header of each column.  \n4. The application will remember the position, the size and the maximized state of the main window. Also any column changes...  \n5. In the list you can right click on an entry and choose an action or use keyboard shortcuts (Insert, E, Return, +, Delete, Alt+Up, Alt+Down, Ctrl+P).  \n6. Usually it takes a few seconds to configure and load the VirtualBox VM but sometimes it will take a little longer, so don\u0027t be alarmed.  \n7. When you start the application or when you add or edit an entry, the application will generate a new ID/GUID for the drive. This is a unique number used internally in VirtualBox for identifying the drive.  \n8. The drive you choose in Add/Edit window will be later recognized and used even if you disconnect/connect other drives before using it again.  \n9. If you receive an warning or an error message from the application, please read the text thoroughly because it will help you solve the problem. The application is designed to deal and solve many problems but, like any computer program, it can\u0027t solve all of them. But I implemented helpful suggestions/informations in these messages so you can easily solve them.  \n10. Before saving the entries list (\\*.vml) the application will backup the previous file in \\*.vml.bak. If you made a change that you don\u0027t like or if the OS/computer malfunctioned and it did not properly saved the vml file then you can restore it by removing the .bak extension.  \nThese files are near the exe file in the portable version or in the \"C:\\\\Users\\\\UserName\\\\AppData\\\\Roaming\\\\Virtual Machine USB Boot folder\" (Windows Vista, 7, 8) in the installed version. In Windows XP they are in the \"C:\\\\Documents and Settings\\\\UserName\\\\Application Data\\\\Virtual Machine USB Boot\" folder. Normally these folders are hidden so you will need to unhide them or use a file manager set to see hidden files and folders.  \n11. The default exe parameters for QEMU are just a \"guideline/example\" on how to boot with QEMU x86/x64. But if you want to use/change other QEMU features you should add more parameters. Also, other QEMU versions may require additional parameters to boot. For example -kernel and -initrd.  \n12. QEMU usually shows 2 windows: one that displays text details about the VM and one with the VM. The \"Run\" option will change the state of the first window.  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n**Changes in 1.51 version:**   \n\n1. The scan for (USB) disks is faster.  \n2. In the Add/Edit window the information about found disks and CDROM drives is shown on columns (name/size/volume letter(s)).  \n3. A few bugs solved.  \n4. Some small improvements to the language code.  \n5. Added german translation (lng file) sent by [Blackcrack](http://reboot.pro/user/43143-blackcrack/ \"\").  \n\n[Click here to download this file](http://reboot.pro/files/file/339-virtual-machine-usb-boot/ \"\")   \n"

I dont understand why the VB devs can not make their program with this function?\n\nI noticed in the last years they are trying to make VB work only with OS\u0027s installed inside the VM. So using a real drive is obviously not preferred.\n\nThey have their reasons for doing this, maybe they\u0027re not 100% bad reasons, but I can\u0027t say because they are not talking about that.\n\nIt\u0027s their right not to talk, of course, but it\u0027s not \"open source\"...\n\nMy personal opinion is: at some point in the future VirtualBox may not be free and open source anymore...\n\n\u003e Does it work with portable VirtualBox also?\n\nIt may not work because the installed version has a specific folder to store the configuration file: C:\\\\Users\\\\UserName\\\\.VirtualBox.\n\nIf the portable version is not using the same folder my application has no way to find the path to the VMs, their names, configuration and so on...\n\nBtw, I\u0027m a big fan of portable versions for any program, but, when I tried a portable VirtualBox version some time ago, I wasn\u0027t too pleased.\n\n2 reasons:\n\n1. VirtualBox is already \"lite\" so using a portable version does not lower the resources usage.\n\n2. the portable version is kinda limited...\n\nBut I\u0027m willing to give it a try...\n\nJust send me a link to your version so I can test it and make the appropriate modifications to VMUB (if necessary)...\n\n"

The configuration file is indeed in another location: \"Portable-VirtualBox\\\\data\\\\.VirtualBox\". So I have to add a new edit box for this in Options. But that\u0027s not such a big problem...  \n2. It starts/closes much slower than the installed version, because in has to register/unregister some services. But VMUB already needs some time to configure and start the VM so this additional delay may be unacceptable for the user.  \n3. If Portable-VirtualBox.exe isn\u0027t loaded VirtualBox.exe and VboxManage.exe can\u0027t be used directly. So, VMUB has to start this exe, after a few seconds the VirtualBox Manager is opened, makes the modifications to the VM and starts it. But some users may not like that VBM must be opened each time.  \n\nMy opinion is most users won\u0027t like the additional delay and/or VBM must be opened.\n\n"

They register an error in the log:\n\n```\nlass-151\\qemu-system-armw.exe: -drive file\u003d\\\\.\\PhysicalDrive1,if\u003dide,index\u003d0,media\u003ddisk,snapshot\u003doff: Block protocol \u0027host_device\u0027 doesn\u0027t support the option \u0027filename\u0027\nlass-151\\qemu-system-armw.exe: -drive file\u003d\\\\.\\PhysicalDrive1,if\u003dide,index\u003d0,media\u003ddisk,snapshot\u003doff: could not open disk image \\\\.\\PhysicalDrive1: Invalid argument\n```\n\nCould it be backslashes in system paths (\\\\\\\\.\\\\PhysicalDrive1) instead of forward-slashes?\n\nI updated to the latest version of your program, and the issue persists.\n\nP.S. I tried using your program with the 0.15 version of Qemu, having specified arm1136 instead of arm1176, it didn\u0027t go well, there\u0027s error messages like \"can\u0027t open root device sr0.\"\n\n"

Both problems solved.  \n- most info/warning/error messages appear now in the middle of their parent window instead of the middle of the screen;  \n- the texts of some messages are improved to help the user more;  \n- each new entry will have \"USB Boot test\" as the default name but it will be selected so it can be easily changed;  \n- a few internal functions are optimized (faster and less CPU usage);  \n- the automatic search for the Qemu exe path is slightly improved;  \n- in Options:  \n- the \"Lock the volumes ...\" option is now checked by default when the application is freshly installed or when you delete the cfg file from the portable version;  \n- added \"Backup the old entries before saving the new ones\" option, checked by default; if you uncheck it, it will not save the old entries as \\*.vml.bak anymore. It is useful when you don\u0027t add/edit/delete entries often or you are sure there will be no problems during the save operation (for example OS, drive and/or electricity problems);  \n- added \"Don\u0027t warn when not able to save the configuration or the entries file (read only medium)\" option, unchecked by default; useful when you start the portable version with a fixed configuration and with fixed entry/es from a read-only medium or with 0% free space (CD, DVD, write-protected USB key/flash/stick, USB key/flash/stick filled with dummy files to prevent virus infection);  \n- the length of the text for all options is limited to reasonable values to prevent \"buffer overflow/overrun\" problems;  \n- in the previous version when pressing F1 was directly loading \"[http://reboot.pro/to...chine-usb-boot/](http://reboot.pro/topic/18736-virtual-machine-usb-boot/ \"\")\" in the default internet browser; also the last items from the context menu of the caption from the main window were directly loading their internet links. Now first checks for an internet connection, then tries if the default link works and, if not, tries a backup one.

But it\u0027s probably just a coincidence...  \n\nIt\u0027s also strange that lately the update checker from VirtualBox Manager doesn\u0027t announce me about the new versions as soon as they are released. More, even if I try the main menu Help \\\u003e\\\u003e Check for updates still doesn\u0027t show a new version.  \nOn your computers does it \"behave\" the same way..? If yes, they should fix it. If not, it\u0027s probably just another coincidence that it happened only on my computer (so many times)...  \n\nPrior releasing VMUB 1.25 I tested it thoroughly with VB 4.2.16 and with 4.3.0 Beta 1. All was fine.  \nIt\u0027s again strange they suddenly decided to release VB 4.2.18 final even if the official Beta version was 4.3.0 Beta 1. But, again, that\u0027s probably just a coincidence.  \n\nAnyway, it seems that 4.2.18 has sometimes problems with the \"storageattach\" command, failing to detach the vmdk.  \nFor those of you who doesn\u0027t know, there is no detach command; \"VBoxManage.exe storageattach \\[GUID_of_the_VM\\] --storagectl IDE/SATA --port \\[n\\] --device \\[n\\] --medium none\" command is used to set the medium to none.  \nThe problem appears when the USB drive is changed with another but having the same \"physical drive number\" as the previous.  \nI will further investigate and come back with the results.  \n\nBTW, this problem doesn\u0027t appear when you use \"Method to update.. \\\u003e\\\u003e directly\" in Options, because this way it doesn\u0027t use vboxmanage commands. So, if you have VB 4.2.18 and often change the USB drive, I advice you to use the \"directly\" method for the time being.\n\n"

      "content": "Thank you Blackcrack.  \n\nWell, I came to the conclusion that the problem is not from my application and there isn\u0027t much I can do to avoid it.  \nWhen vboxmanage.exe is called many times at some point it will refuse to do the job. It will wait 30 seconds and it will autoclose with exit code 1. It resembles somehow with the VirtualBox fast restart problem.  \nThe problem exists in all VirtualBox versions but in those \\\u003c\\\u003e 4.2.18 it was, let\u0027s say, on an acceptable level. In 4.2.18 it does it more often...  \nWhen it works properly each job is done in about half a second. So I implemented a \"waiting time to finish\" of 15 seconds for each of them, which is enough even on slow computers.  \nIt\u0027s a little strange that they decided to set the autoclose time to 30 seconds. But, what is even more strange, the problem appears ONLY when vboxmanage.exe is called by another exe, not when it\u0027s started directly or from a batch file.\n\n"

Or when you change the USB drive a few times very fast and click on Start button each time. This way you\u0027ll force VMUB to call vboxmanage.exe many times in a short amount of time and it will increase the chances that something would go wrong. But the regular users don\u0027t do that very often...  \nAnyway I advice you to use the \"method to update.. \\\u003e\\\u003e directly\" in Options and use the vboxmanage method only when is really necessary.\n\n"

In other words, I came to this forum to look up information about using a USB key drive made bootable, to start a Vm (in VirtualBox), but on ***Linux*** . This was an entirely Windows-centric thread as far as i saw when I scanned it, and it amazes me how tech people sorts themselves into exclusive communities that do not even acknowledge other communities. For example, the original post by DavidB does not even show the term \"++*Windows*++\" until entry #9 under \"TIPS\". And nowhere does the term Linux appear in that top post.\n\nSo, it is a more than reasonable (set of) question(s). \"Can it run on Linux\"? \"Can the source code compile on other OSes\"?\n\nIt\u0027s jumping the gun for me to say so, but my response is (a guess, totally based on background knowledge) *No, this tool will not run on Linux* (not in any way shape or form, not Wine, whatever) and *no, it cannot be compiled for Linux* . USB **is system driver programming** , so if someone thinks it is just a trivial thing to make a Windows utility build and run right on the other kind of OS they are guessing out of basic ++*ignorance*++. The system level is where the OSes differ extremely from one another, in other words.\n\nit is only the rare project leader who seems brave enough to create a utility like that that is maintained for more than one platform. I do not blame DavidB if he isn\u0027t up to doing that.\n\nThe last time I checked, it was, by the way, very unworkable to try to boot a VirtualBox VM from a USB device on **Linux**. It just doesn\u0027t work right. While it might look like some pieces are there, extreme bugs were (as late as 6 months ago) apparent to a user like me who experimented with it. OTOH, the QEMU software was able to do it for me on Linux.\n\n"

It\u0027s not my problem, though. It\u0027s a problem other people are having. And I\u0027ve learned (over 50, here) to not automatically make other people\u0027s problems my own.\n\nSo, I think most readers can understand the meaning of my post pretty well, and if not, well, it\u0027s not because I did not try to write clearly, completely, and correctly. Actually the Internet is overbrimming with people of all nationalities who exhibit very serious cognitive disabilities, and it is not just a matter of lingistic educational background.

More than one person in this thread reports it.\n\nIs it true right now? When I have some time I will look into it. I don\u0027t take for granted that what I read on forums is fully correct.\n\n\u003e Maybe, if you start (not here, but rather here: [http://reboot.pro/fo...er-os-flavours/](http://reboot.pro/forum/70-boot-linux-and-other-os-flavours/ \"\") ) a new thread detailing what specific issues you are having, someone may help you.\n\nWhen I have some time, I will look into it.\n\nWhy do I keep saying that? \"**When I have some time** ...\"?\n\nBecause there **is incredible amounts of bad information** being volunteered on the Internet. In forums just like this one. And all over.\n\nPeople seem to enjoy posting what they know. It clearly does not matter to some of them if they\u0027ve tried something out themselves or even thoroughly researched. But then if anyone contradicts them, very commonly, they go absolutely bonkers with taking offence. The net result is incredible amounts of time wasted. Wasted time with the occasional real expert replying to these gumbys. Wasted by learners who hope to get insight to how to solve a problem they want to solve, and get led to try something that was doomed, totally doomed, to fail, from the very start. Because some well-meaning person posted typical forum-style advice or comments in a typical forum way - usually in barely adequate English as well as not meeting the criteria for believable advice (**substantiation** **relevance detail** and **reference** ). I\u0027m always trying to catch up from the time people like this *make me waste*.\n\nI don\u0027t find your contradiction of what I wrote convincing, sorry. Go ballistic if you want. But you cited (\"Using a physical drive or device in Virtualbox under Linux is fairly easy.\") [https://www.virtualb...09.html#rawdisk](https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch09.html#rawdisk \"External link\") and I went there and thought \"Oh, I recognize this. Been here before.\"\n\nApparently *fairly easy* is an easygoing translation from: **Warning** *Raw hard disk access is for expert users only.* ![:superstition:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/superstition.gif)\n\nEven at that, NOTE that nowhere in that section is USB specifically mentioned. I\u0027d love to see a complete and therefore convincing, useful blog-like article with step-by-step, maybe screenshots, snippets of code or configuration, etc., from someone who has actually made such a setup work (in VirtualBox, on Linux) - booting *from a USB drive*.\n\nSorry, this was all rather off the topic of the thread. I just put it here because I want to try not to waste other people\u0027s time even though other people seem extremely ready to waste *mine*. It\u0027s an old old ethical thing. \"Do unto others ...\". So readers can read it all here. And not waste their time.\n\nI will not reply here to further challenges on this matter. Ciao.\n\n"

Usually VBoxManage.exe takes about 0.5..1 sec to do the job so 3 sec is enough to know that something is wrong if it gets stuck.  \n3. The VBoxManage.exe usage in VMUB was decreased to minimum.

If a VirtualBox.exe session (Manager or VM) is reopened before VBoxSVC of a previous session is automatically closed, it is \"reassigned\" to the new session. Seems a good idea because it will load faster and the memory will be less fragmented.  \nBut unfortunately this does not always function with VBoxManage.exe too. When VBoxSVC is about to be closed or it is closed, VBoxManage.exe sometimes does not load VBoxSVC and shows that error.  \nWhen VB Manager is opened all the time it keeps VBoxSVC opened as well and VBoxManage.exe can use it.\n\n"

This usually happened when I quickly restart VMUB after quitting a session. No other user app was running and simply waiting for 20-30 seconds and re-running VMUB worked.\n\nIt struck me that this might be caused by my installed AV solution. When VMUB runs and quits, it remounts the USB drive. This would cause the AV s/w to see a \u0027new\u0027 drive and scan it which presumably would lock the USB drive until it had finished scanning. I disabled my AV (Avast) and the problem went away. Not much you can do about this except maybe provide the option to force a dismount of the USB drive on request? Of course I could configure my AV to not scan USB devices too.\n\n"

If it will not find it, it will \"switch\" to updating directly, solving your problem.\n\nThe detection code is checking every time you click on the Start button, so it will adapt if you close or restart VB Manager.\n\nGive it a try... :smile:\n\n\u003e Also, the .vmdk shows up as inaccessible in VBox mgr (as in the video) unless I login as user\u003dadmin so I can\u0027t run the VM from VBox in this mode.\n\nA normal user can\u0027t access a real drive directly. That\u0027s why VB and VMUB have to be started as an administrator.\n\nUnfortunately I can\u0027t change this because Windows is made this way.\n\nBTW, Linux is even \"worst\" with this ![:D](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/biggrin.png)\n\n"

      "content": "Merry Christmas to everybody!  \n\nWell, I have discovered something interesting.  \n\nFirst, let\u0027s review a little: the VirtualBox COM server (VBoxSVC.exe) is started and used as (only) one instance by the VBox Manager (VirtualBox.exe), by the VBox VMs (VirtualBox.exe with parameter) and by the VBoxManage.exe.  \nWhen all VirtualBox.exe and VBoxManage.exe instances are closed, VBoxSVC.exe process is waiting about 6 sec, it\u0027s \"marked\" for closing and in about 12 sec is closed.  \nIf VirtualBox.exe or VBoxManage.exe instances are started in that 6..12 sec time interval, they will fail, because a new instance of the VBoxSVC.exe can\u0027t be created (as it is limited to only one) and the current one is closing.  \nThis is the bug they introduced in VBox 4.2.20, since in VBox \\\u003c\u003d 4.2.18 you could open more than one VBoxSVC.exe instances. More, they \"amplified\" the problem in VBox \\\u003e\u003d 4.3.0 by increasing the time interval VBoxSvc.exe is closing from 1..2 sec to 6..7 sec.  \n\nBut, if I kill the VBoxSVC.exe instance right after I use VirtualBox.exe or VBoxManage.exe (so before marking it for closing) and I start VBoxSVC.exe directly before using VirtualBox.exe or VBoxManage.exe again, there is no error anymore :smile:  \n\nI think it could also solve Steve\u0027s problem.  \nSteve, you could test it yourself by starting VBoxSVC.exe before using VMUB first time in that Windows session.  \n\nBut there is a problem: killing a process is not a good idea (for good reasons). And killing it every time you start a VM is even less...  \n\nWhat do you think about that...?\n\n"

Added support for multiple translations.  \nThe language files can be stored in a Languages folder near the exe file (for the portable version), in Application Data folder for the installed version or in the resources of the exe file.  \nThey are in fact XML files and can be edited using any XML editor.  \nIf you want to help by translating VMUB into your language you can use the english.lng file as template. Just rename the file and translate only the text values (not the names).  \n2. Some of the resources from the exe file could of been accessed only by OSs with a few codepages. Now they can be accessed by OSs with any codepage.  \n3. The exe file size was reduced by compressing the large icons.  \n4.

But, if you have many disks connected and you notice a long delay in their scan, could be from the security solution. For example I noticed that Comodo Internet Security delays every access to each removable disk with a few hundred ms. It may not seem much, but when you have a few disks connected and VMUB accesses each of them 2..3 times (to get all their data), it will become noticeable (but not very annoying). I advise you to notify the security solution support so they can fix the problem.  \nJust so you know:  \n1. For most of the security solutions, deactivating it from its icon in tray won\u0027t help. For Comodo I had to uninstall it to get rid of the delay.  \n2. When the delay from the security solution is gone, VMUB accesses each disk in a matter of ms.\n\nLE: download links removed, you can find a better version in the next posts.\n\n"

I restored a clean system via an acronis image beforehand.\n\nThis was in the context of testing imagix related stuff on some syspreped win7x64-pe usb-stick.\n\nI tried the createrawvmdk command before landing on this website and it also gave me an error of somekind but later (while windows was loading), even with vbox 4.3.12.\n\nAnyway thank You DavidB your app is excellent.\n\n"
