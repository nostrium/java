      "content": "I used Rufus to make a bootable USB using an ISO of Windows 10 Pro while setting the \"Partition Scheme\" to GPT \\\u0026 \"File System\" to FAT32, BIOS set to boot in \"UEFI only\" mode \\\u0026 \"Secure Boot\" feature was disabled.\n\nNow, the Boot Screen detects the USB drive as UEFI device but the problem is that it never starts the installation process after being selected! It just goes back to the Boot Screen.\n\nI tried enabling CSM \\\u0026 legacy boot mode, as well as changing the USB port used, but to no avail.\n\nMy Mobo is Gigabyte x370 K7.\n\nYour help is highly appreciated.\n\nThanks so much guys!  \n\n"
