(Win8 and beyond)  \nReference \u0027CurrentControlSet\u0027 of your booting system is set to first Input.  \n- Select \\[Edit\\]-\\[Offline Windows\\]  \n- Navigate and select \u0027Offline Windows\u0027 directory.  \nActive \u0027ControlSet000n\u0027 of remote Windows system is set to second Input.  \n- Click \\[Read/Compare/Edit\\] to see values-table. Look for \u0027Diverse\u003d1\u0027.  \n- Select mis-configured boot driver (if any) from the table and press \\[Run User Func\\].  \n- Set new valuename (REG-DWORD) to match correct one.  \n- Click \\[OK\\] to write to Registry.  \n- Click \\[Cancel\\] to open Registry and edit manually.  \n\nIf any mis-configured driver was the reason for non booting system your problem might be fixed.  \n\nSpecial Features:  \n- to filter the \u0027usual suspects\u0027 e.g. disk drivers, provide a file with a list,  \nname it BootConfigComperator.ini to be auto-recognized by the program at start.  \n- there is a chance to install a sample file \\[Help\\]-\\[Install Config Sample\\].  \n- use any config-file of this kind as parameter, e.g. \u0027BootConfigComperator.exe B:\\\\myConfig.ini\u0027.  \n- if filter is loaded, it is indicated in the GUI.  \n- use \\[Help\\]-\\[Debug Mode\\] to display error messages when loading offline Registry fails.  \n- to edit \u0027CurrentControlSet\u0027 leave empty second Input.  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nHope this helps to get some non booting system started.  \n\nRegards T.  \n\nThe password for the file is: **bcc**  \n\n[Click here to download this file](http://reboot.pro/files/file/622-bootconfigcomperator/ \"\")   \n"

      "content": "Thanks for this Quite Interesting App :smile:\n\nIt will be better when BootConfigComperator_x64.exe is Auto launched as Administrator, which is required to make Offline Windows Selection valid.\n\nThis can be simply achieved by using in AutoIt3 code e.g. as first line\n\n```\n#RequireAdmin\n```\n\nWith this line added to the AutoIt3 code the program is always launched as Administrator\n\nJust did some preliminary test and I think the program can be quite useful. :smile:\n\nIn my case the Running OS has a lot of Services that do not occur in the Offline Windows.\n\nThat is not a problem, but Diverse gives Notification 1 which might indicate a problem.\n\nMay be the Diverse Notifications can be further refined as e.g.\n\n1 \u003d Service Start value is different, which might indicate a problem\n\n2 \u003d Service does Not exist in Offline Windows\n\n3 \u003d Service does Not exist in Running OS\n\nYour 32-bits program is Not considered as a Virus,\n\nwhereas my AutoIt3 32-bits programs mostly are in conflict with Windows Defender and are Blocked at First Sight.\n\nDo you have any idea How to solve this problem in my case ?\n\n"
