      "content": "@wimb  \n\nI am new to UEFI and I am experimenting a lot using your excellent UEFI_MULTI package.  \nFollowing are my reports and understandings. Please correct me if needed.  \n\nI have an USB hard disk with multiboot-capability with only one partition, MBR mode, NTFS format, using grub4dos (called OLD_MULTIBOOT).  \nWith UEFI/GPT, I understand that grub4dos does not support GPT, so I cannot use it for GPT disks (for example for internal hard disk of systems with Windows 8).  \nMy USB HDD is MBR, so grub4dos is OK but since it is in NTFS, it cannot boot on UEFI system, so I use your UEFI_MULTI  \nwhere the first partition (bootable) must be in FAT32, and contains EFI directory and files, to be able to boot on both  \nUEFI and non-UEFI (\u003dBIOS) system.  \n\nSo I understand that using UEFI_MULTI I can boot some UEFI-aware systems (like Parted Magic, Fedora, Ubuntu and Windows 8-64).  \nImportant question : Once booted UEFI Windows 8-64, in BCD there is an entry for grub4dos, does it mean that I can then boot all entries listed in my menu.lst on my existing USB HDD OLD_MULTIBOOT? If the answer is yes, then this is fantastic!  \nIn other words, this would mean:  \na- on BIOS systems, I can boot directly grub4dos and everything in my working menu.lst\n\nb- on UEFI systems, I can boot some UEFI-aware OSes, then by chainloading grub4dos from UEFI Windows boot manager, I can boot everything as in a).  \nCould you confirm or infirm?  \n\nNow about UEFI_MULTI procedure.  \nI did not understand the need for 4 partitions. So I use only 2 partitions: one primary in FAT32 about 20 GB,  \nthe other primary in NTFS. All in MBR mode. The new multiboot USB HDD is called NEW_MULTIBOOT.  \nIn FAT32 partition, I copied the /boot directory and bootmgr from OLD_MULTIBOOT USB HDD. The FAT32 partition has grub4dos installed in MBR.  \nIn NTFS partition, I copied my existing VHD bootable from my menu.lst.  \nThen I run UEFI_MULTI.exe: checked Add EFI Boot manager, Add grub4dos to Boot manager. Add VHD and add Boot Win7/8 are greyed out.  \nBoot image file: make_pe3 iso file. I manually copy pmagic and images directory to FAT32 partition. After completion, I tested in UEFI system.  \n- Refind EFI boot manager is OK  \n- Parted Magic 64 hang on black screen at boot  \n- Parted Magic 32 is OK  \n- I cannot boot Win8 x64 EFI. 8bootx64.efi not found.  \nSo I take it from bootx64.efi from existing Win8-64 system (hidden partition). Reboot: got message:  \n---  \nfailed to start  \nStatus: 0xc000000f  \n\\\\EFI\\\\Microsoft\\\\Boot\\\\BCD  \nInfo: The Boot Configuration Data for your PC is missing or contains errors.  \nSo I copied \\\\boot from FAT32 partition to \\\\EFI\\\\Microsoft (directory to be created first). Then reboot, choose Win8 VHD entry: the system reboots instead of booting Win8 VHD!\n\nIf I choose the grub4dos - XP entry, I got the message :  \nFile: \\\\grldr  \nStatus: 0xc000007b  \nInfo: The application or operating system couldn\u0027t be loaded because a required file is missing or contains errors.  \n---  \nIn FAT32, there is boot.ini created by UEFI_MULTI with content:  \n\\[Boot Loader\\]  \nTimeout\u003d20  \nDefault\u003dC:\\\\grldr  \n\\[Operating Systems\\]  \nC:\\\\grldr\u003d\"Start GRUB4DOS - XP Menu\"  \n---  \n\nSo I am stucked now.  \nPlease comment, thank you.  \n\nEdit: I made few progressions.  \n\nThe missing 8bootx64.efi file, the missing \\\\boot directory etc... problem were due to the  \nfact that either Win8 must be installed on USB system drive, or the Win8 USB stick recovery content  \nmust be copied to UEFI_MULTI\\\\MULTI_BOOT directory. Then in the program select copy to boot drive  \nwith source folder UEFI_MULTI\\\\MULTI_BOOT.  \n\nSince I also have a VHD to boot, I use EasyBCD to add this entry to the BCD. You need to add to FAT32  \n\\\\boot and \\\\efi\\\\microboot\\\\boot.  \n\nSo now on UEFI boot, I have 3 entries: Win8 VHD, Windows Setup, and grub4dos.  \n- Win8 VHD entry gives reboot!  \n- Windows setup entry works.  \n- grub4dos entry give 0x7B error with \\\\grldr!\n\n"

      "content": "@wimb  \n\nI am new to UEFI and I am experimenting a lot using your excellent UEFI_MULTI package.  \nFollowing are my reports and understandings. Please correct me if needed.  \n\nI have an USB hard disk with multiboot-capability with only one partition, MBR mode, NTFS format, using grub4dos (called OLD_MULTIBOOT).  \nWith UEFI/GPT, I understand that grub4dos does not support GPT, so I cannot use it for GPT disks (for example for internal hard disk of systems with Windows 8).  \nMy USB HDD is MBR, so grub4dos is OK but since it is in NTFS, it cannot boot on UEFI system, so I use your UEFI_MULTI  \nwhere the first partition (bootable) must be in FAT32, and contains EFI directory and files, to be able to boot on both  \nUEFI and non-UEFI (\u003dBIOS) system.  \n\nSo I understand that using UEFI_MULTI I can boot some UEFI-aware systems (like Parted Magic, Fedora, Ubuntu and Windows 8-64).  \nImportant question : Once booted UEFI Windows 8-64, in BCD there is an entry for grub4dos, does it mean that I can then boot all entries listed in my menu.lst on my existing USB HDD OLD_MULTIBOOT? If the answer is yes, then this is fantastic!  \nIn other words, this would mean:  \na- on BIOS systems, I can boot directly grub4dos and everything in my working menu.lst\n\nb- on UEFI systems, I can boot some UEFI-aware OSes, then by chainloading grub4dos from UEFI Windows boot manager, I can boot everything as in a).  \nCould you confirm or infirm?  \n\nNow about UEFI_MULTI procedure.  \nI did not understand the need for 4 partitions. So I use only 2 partitions: one primary in FAT32 about 20 GB,  \nthe other primary in NTFS. All in MBR mode. The new multiboot USB HDD is called NEW_MULTIBOOT.  \nIn FAT32 partition, I copied the /boot directory and bootmgr from OLD_MULTIBOOT USB HDD. The FAT32 partition has grub4dos installed in MBR.  \nIn NTFS partition, I copied my existing VHD bootable from my menu.lst.  \nThen I run UEFI_MULTI.exe: checked Add EFI Boot manager, Add grub4dos to Boot manager. Add VHD and add Boot Win7/8 are greyed out.  \nBoot image file: make_pe3 iso file. I manually copy pmagic and images directory to FAT32 partition. After completion, I tested in UEFI system.  \n- Refind EFI boot manager is OK  \n- Parted Magic 64 hang on black screen at boot  \n- Parted Magic 32 is OK  \n- I cannot boot Win8 x64 EFI. 8bootx64.efi not found.  \nSo I take it from bootx64.efi from existing Win8-64 system (hidden partition). Reboot: got message:  \n---  \nfailed to start  \nStatus: 0xc000000f  \n\\\\EFI\\\\Microsoft\\\\Boot\\\\BCD  \nInfo: The Boot Configuration Data for your PC is missing or contains errors.  \nSo I copied \\\\boot from FAT32 partition to \\\\EFI\\\\Microsoft (directory to be created first). Then reboot, choose Win8 VHD entry: the system reboots instead of booting Win8 VHD!\n\nIf I choose the grub4dos - XP entry, I got the message :  \nFile: \\\\grldr  \nStatus: 0xc000007b  \nInfo: The application or operating system couldn\u0027t be loaded because a required file is missing or contains errors.  \n---  \nIn FAT32, there is boot.ini created by UEFI_MULTI with content:  \n\\[Boot Loader\\]  \nTimeout\u003d20  \nDefault\u003dC:\\\\grldr  \n\\[Operating Systems\\]  \nC:\\\\grldr\u003d\"Start GRUB4DOS - XP Menu\"  \n---  \n\nSo I am stucked now.  \nPlease comment, thank you.  \n\nEdit: I made few progressions.  \n\nThe missing 8bootx64.efi file, the missing \\\\boot directory etc... problem were due to the  \nfact that either Win8 must be installed on USB system drive, or the Win8 USB stick recovery content  \nmust be copied to UEFI_MULTI\\\\MULTI_BOOT directory. Then in the program select copy to boot drive  \nwith source folder UEFI_MULTI\\\\MULTI_BOOT.  \n\nSince I also have a VHD to boot, I use EasyBCD to add this entry to the BCD. You need to add to FAT32  \n\\\\boot and \\\\efi\\\\microboot\\\\boot.  \n\nSo now on UEFI boot, I have 3 entries: Win8 VHD, Windows Setup, and grub4dos.  \n- Win8 VHD entry gives reboot!  \n- Windows setup entry works.  \n- grub4dos entry give 0x7B error with \\\\grldr!\n\n"

Still Got message : 0xc0000359 \\\\windows\\\\system32\\\\boot\\\\winload.efi.  \n\nIf I could replace Win7PE and Win8PE with their 64-bit version and use their wim, I wonder whether they can be booted in UEFI mode?  \nI have no 64-bit wim to try.  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nTo summarize what I understand by using UEFI_MULTI:  \na- with BIOS system, no problem for multiboot using known loaders (grub4dos, bootmgr, syslinux, ntldr...)  \nb- with UEFI system, if you can disable Secureboot and enable CSM (compatibility support modules), then same booting capabiliy as in a).  \nIf CSM disabled, and Secureboot enabled/disabled, you can boot EFI compatible systems as grub2, Win8-64, rEFInd, PartedMagic, Fedora, Ubuntu etc...  \nWin8-64 could in flat OS ou in VHD.\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n"

So am I stuck with only  \n/efi/boot/bootx64.efi \u003d /EFI/Microsoft/boot/bootmgfw.efi, this means I can only boot Windows 8.x 64-bit  \nwhen Secure Boot is enabled, requiring copy from /EFI/Microsoft/boot/bootmgfw.efi to /EFI/bootx64.efi.  \n\nNow I find a way to boot, in addition to Windows 8.x 64-bit, other non-signed or signed Linux kernels  \nlike Parted Magic, Ubuntu 14.04..., without changing anything.  \nThe method is taken from AltLinux.  \nYou have to adapt the configuration files (refind.conf, elilo.conf).  \nIt works because \\*.efi files have been signed by AltLinux, and thanks the trick of using ELILO to chainload  \nunsigned Linux kernels.  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nInside /EFI/boot/ directory I have:  \n\nicons\\\\ \u003d\\\u003e from refind included with Alt Linux  \nrefind.conf \u003d\\\u003e see below  \nelilo.conf \u003d\\\u003e see below  \ntextmenu-message.msg \u003d\\\u003e from ELILO  \ngrubx64.efi \u003d\\\u003e from AltLinux (\u003d signed refind.efi)  \nelilo.efi \u003d\\\u003e from AltLinux  \nbootx64.efi \u003d\\\u003e from AltLinux  \nMokManager.efi \u003d\\\u003e from AltLinux  \ngeneral.msg \u003d\\\u003e from ELILO  \nparams.msg \u003d\\\u003e from ELILO  \n\nrefind.conf content:\n\n```\ntimeout 20\nscanfor manual\nscan_driver_dirs /EFI/refind/drivers_x64\nbanner /EFI/refind/icons/bg.png\n\nmenuentry \"Windows 8 x64 (PE/VHD) EFI\" {\n  icon /EFI/boot/icons/os_win.png\n  loader /EFI/Microsoft/boot/bootmgfw.efi\n  #disabled\n}\n\n# ELILO used as Secure Boot trampoline for unsigned kernels\nmenuentry \"Ubuntu, PartedMagic...\" {\n  icon /EFI/boot/icons/os_linux.png\n  loader /EFI/BOOT/elilo.efi\n}\n\nmenuentry \"others\" {\n  # others: Mokmanager, UEFI shell etc...\n  icon /EFI/refind/icons/os_unknown.png\n  loader /EFI/refind/refind_x64.efi\n}\n\n```\n\nelilo.conf content:\n\n```\nprompt\n# wait 20 seconds before booting default\ntimeout\u003d200\ndefault\u003dUbuntu\nchooser\u003dtextmenu\nmessage\u003dtextmenu-message.msg\n\n###\n\nimage\u003d\"/EFI/ubuntu/vmlinuz-3.13.0-43-generic\"\n   label\u003d\"Ubuntu\"\n   description\u003d\"Ubuntu 14.04\"\n   initrd\u003d/EFI/ubuntu/initrd.img-3.13.0-43-generic\n   read-only\n   # note: you need to change UUID to the UUID of your Linux partition\n   append\u003d\"root\u003dUUID\u003db08a3f56-9df0-4a91-b7a5-27b854f2b5d8 ro  quiet splash $vt_handoff\"\n\n###\nimage\u003d\"/pmagic/bzImage64\"  \n   label\u003d\"PartedMagic\"\n   description\u003d\"Parted Magic (2014-11-19)\"\n   initrd\u003d/pmagic/initrd64.img\n   read-only\n   append\u003d\"edd\u003doff load_ramdisk\u003d1 prompt_ramdisk\u003d0 rw vga\u003dnormal loglevel\u003d9 max_loop\u003d256 vmalloc\u003d288MiB directory\u003d/ keymap\u003dfr\"\n\nTo summarize, using this method, my multiboot USB hard disk has following structure:\n```\n\n- grub4dos in MBR  \n- 1 FAT32 primary partition with Easy2boot  \n- 1 NTFS primary partition for data, WIM and big (\\\u003e 4 GB) ISO, VHD  \n- 1 Linux ext4 logical partition for Ubuntu 14.04  \n- 1 Linux swap logical partition for Linux swap  \n\nSo Easy2boot still has 4th primary partition to work.  \nImportant: the NTFS partition needs to be primary and not logical, because if logical, the VHD files will not be found in UEFI mode (no BCD entry displayed for them, while in BIOS mode there is n   \n"

      "content": "This is my first post here, so I hope I\u0027m not asking something that\u0027s been answered a hundred times before...\n\nSince I\u0027m using Windows 8.1 my current boot method is UEFI. I stumbled upon these forums while trying to find a way to put a number of different Linux OSes, my Windows 8.1, and some Rescue Utilities onto a 32gb USB.\n\nThe USB drive I ended up with at the end of the process was not recognized by my UEFI. It was, however, recognized by the CSM but in that situation none of the OSes I put onto the USB showed up!\n\nHere\u0027s what I ended up doing, maybe when you look at my steps, you\u0027ll be able to tell me what happened and how I can fix it when I try again.\n\nI downloaded UEFI_MULTI_85.exe from [http://reboot.pro/fi...boot-usb-drive/](http://reboot.pro/files/download/279-uefi-multi-make-multi-boot-usb-drive/ \"\"). When I opened the file, it used 7zip to auto-extract everything into a \\\\UEFI-Multi\\\\ folder. That part I\u0027m pretty sure I got right. Since it\u0027d be really difficult to do that wrong! From there, I read the UEFI_MULTI_Help.txt file and though I understood how to use the software. I inserted the USB drive I wanted to use and ran UFD_Format.exe and believe everything worked perfectly find there as well. I then had what I think is a properly formatted FAT32 USB drive.\n\nI then went into the \\\\MULTI_BOOT\\\\Images folder. I put all the OS and Rescue ISOs I wanted to be available:\n\n*Windows*:\n\nWindows.8.1.blah.blah.blah.iso\n\n*Linux*:\n\nantergos-2015.04.12-x86_64.iso\n\narchlinux-2015.06.01-dual.iso\n\nBella-OS-2.2-64bit.iso\n\nblack-lab-linux-2015_6-x86_64.iso\n\nblack-lab-linux-Xfce4.12-x64_86.iso\n\nbridge-xfce-2014.02-x86_64.iso\n\nchakra-2015.03-euler-x86_64.iso\n\nchaletos14.04.2-feb2015-light-amd64.iso\n\ndeepin_2014.3_amd64.iso\n\nelementaryos-freya-amd64.20150411.iso\n\nhandylinux-2.1.iso\n\nKaOS-2015.06-x86_64.iso\n\nkubuntu-15.04-desktop-amd64.iso\n\nMakuluLinux-8-LxFce.iso\n\nMakuluLinux-9-Aero-x64.iso\n\nMakuluLinux-9-XfceLite-x64.iso\n\nmanjaro-kde-0.8.13-x86_64.iso\n\nmanjaro-xfce-0.8.13-x86_64.iso\n\nmaui-0.5.1-x86_64.iso\n\nnetrunner-16-dvd-64bit.iso\n\nnetrunner-rolling-2014.09.1-dvd-64bit.iso\n\nPinguy_OS_14.04.2-LTS-x86-64.iso\n\nSolus-Beta2.iso\n\nsymphonyos-15.0_amd64.iso\n\nwattOS-R9-64.iso\n\n*Rescue*:\n\nHiren\u0027s.BootCD.15.2.iso\n\nPING-3.02-WithAddons.iso\n\nubcd535.iso\n\nIn total, all of the above was just under 28gb. Luckily, the USB drive I just formatted had 29gb available.\n\nI then went back to the main UEFI_MULTI folder and ran UEFI_MULTI.exe as Administrator. I told it that my USB Boot was D: (the USB drive I just formatted) and my System Drive was C: (where Windows 8.1 is currently installed, of course). I kept the Copy to: Boot Drive option and told it that the Source Folder was \\\\MULTI_BOOT\\\\Images.\n\nAt this point, I might have made the error by selecting all the available options:\n\n✔ Add G4D to Boot Manager\n\n✔ Add XP to Boot Manager\n\n✔ Update MBR Boot Code\n\n✔ Add Boot Win 7/8 System\n\n✔ Update Grub4Dos gldr\n\n✔ Grub 2 EFI Mgr\n\nShould I not have selected everything? If not, which of those options should I select, and which should I leave alone?\n\nIt did its thing and everything seemed fine when it finished. But like I said at the beginning, when I rebooted my computer the UEFI did not detect the USB and went straight to Windows 8.1. When I switched my BIOS to CSM, it did detect the USB, but nothing was selectable except for the default options such as editing the Grub4Dos menu.\n\nWhat can you tell me about what I might have done incorrectly? Is there anything that obviously jumps out at you?\n\nMaybe someone can walk me through this process again so the next time I will be successful attempt to make a Multi-Boot USB with the above listed OSes and Rescue ISOs.\n\nThanks a lot!\n\n〜 Ev\n\n"

(This works great with a marker file on the NTFS partition, like CDDrive X Y plugin for PE SE version that assigns the letter Y to the USB, this makes it super easy for this setup to work)\n\nI have it working but I have to go in and remove the boot menu afterwards(I just set boot-wim to defaut with EasyBCD then skip the timer for both bcds)\n\nBefore that I was unsuccessfully trying to select the UFD format created Fat32 partition as the boot partition, then picking the WIM, and selecting the NTFS partition as the system partition? Then picking \"copy to\" and \"system\" and picking the extracted folder from the ISO containing only the files I wanted on the system partition from the but I get an error, maybe I was using it wrong.

      "content": "FWIW I found a way to multi-boot a Linux system on a Secure Boot UEFI system. I installed Porteus on a USB drive and it supported booting on BIOS and UEFI systems but Secure Boot had to be disabled for UEFI, which is fine if you own the pc or you can change it\u0027s configuration. But this is not always permitted or possible on some machines.\n\nThe solution I found was to add Ubuntu\u0027s grub2 files to the USB drive. Ubuntu\u0027s grub2 supports Secure Boot.\n\nThis is the bash script I used to copy the Ubuntu grub2 file from a live Ubuntu ISO to the USB system.\n\n```\n#!/bin/bash\n# Add Ubuntu grub2 Secure Boot support to Porteus USB system.\n \nUbuntuISO\u003d/mnt/sda6/ISOs/ubuntu-18.04.1-desktop-amd64.iso    # Change to fit your system\nUSBdrv\u003d/mnt/sdb1                                             # Change to fit your system\n \nif [ `whoami` !\u003d \"root\" ]; then\n   echo -e \"Enter root\u0027s password\"\n   su -c \"sh $0 $1\"\n   exit\nfi\nif [ ! -f $USBdrv/USB_INSTALLATION.txt ]; then               # Change to fit your system\n   echo \"Porteus USB drive not found.\"\n   read\n   exit\nfi\nif [ ! -f $UbuntuISO ]; then\n   echo \"Ubuntu ISO not found.\"\n   read\n   exit\nfi\nmloop $UbuntuISO\n#read\nmv $USBdrv/EFI/boot              $USBdrv/EFI/Porteusboot           # Backup Porteus EFI\nmkdir                            $USBdrv/EFI/BOOT\nmkdir                            $USBdrv/boot/grub\ncp -ar /mnt/loop/EFI/BOOT/*      $USBdrv/EFI/BOOT/\ncp -ar /mnt/loop/boot/grub/*     $USBdrv/boot/grub/\nmv $USBdrv/boot/grub/grub.cfg    $USBdrv/boot/grub/Ubuntugrub.cfg  # Backup Ubuntu grub.cfg\necho \" \"\necho \"Now add the posted grub.cfg file to the $USBdrv/boot/grub/ folder.\"\necho \"Customize the new grub.cfg\u0027s porteus_parms in the Secure Boot menu.\"\necho \" \"\nread\nls  $USBdrv/EFI/BOOT\nls  $USBdrv/boot\nls  $USBdrv/boot/grub\ncat $USBdrv/boot/grub/grub.cfg\nuloop\n```\n\nAnd the grub2 cfg file I used is:\n\n```\nif loadfont /boot/grub/font.pf2 ; then\n# set gfxmode\u003dauto\nset gfxmode\u003d800x600,auto\ninsmod efi_gop\ninsmod efi_uga\ninsmod gfxterm\nterminal_output gfxterm\nfi\nset menu_color_normal\u003dwhite/black\nset menu_color_highlight\u003dblack/light-gray\nset timeout\u003d60\nset gfxpayload\u003d1024x768\n\nmenuentry \" 1.

These are optional for testing the boot options.\n\nSecureboot.sh\n\n```\n#!/bin/sh\n# Switch standard Porteus boot config to UEFI Secure Boot config.\nUSBdrv\u003d/mnt/sdb1   # USB drive\nif [ -d $USBdrv/EFI/UbuntuBOOT ]; then\n   mv $USBdrv/EFI/boot         $USBdrv/EFI/Porteusboot\n   mv $USBdrv/EFI/UbuntuBOOT   $USBdrv/EFI/boot\nelse\n   echo \"  UEFI Secure Boot config already in place.\"\nfi\n```\n\nBIOSboot.sh\n\n```\n#!/bin/sh\n# Switch UEFI Secure Boot config to standard Porteus boot config.\nUSBdrv\u003d/mnt/sdb1   # USB drive\nif [ -d $USBdrv/EFI/Porteusboot ]; then\n   mv -f $USBdrv/EFI/boot         $USBdrv/EFI/UbuntuBOOT\n   mv -f $USBdrv/EFI/Porteusboot  $USBdrv/EFI/boot\nelse\n   echo \"  Porteus boot config already in place.\"\nfi\n```\n\nSo the system works on both Secure Boot and disabled Secure Boot systems. But it\u0027s not as clean as I would like.\n\nSo I\u0027ve been working with trying to get the automatic switching mode code to work again. And it still doesn\u0027t work in Secure Boot mode..\n\n```\nif loadfont /boot/grub/font.pf2 ; then\n# set gfxmode\u003dauto\nset gfxmode\u003d800x600,auto\ninsmod efi_gop\ninsmod efi_uga\ninsmod gfxterm\nterminal_output gfxterm\nfi\nset menu_color_normal\u003dwhite/black\nset menu_color_highlight\u003dblack/light-gray\nset timeout\u003d60\nset gfxpayload\u003d1024x768\nset SB\u003d0\nset efibootmgr\u003d/EFI/Porteusboot/bootx64.efi\nset porteus_parms\u003d\"volume\u003d33 reboot\u003dcold extramod\u003d/Modules;/Modsavedat noload\u003dsave.dat;cinnamon\"\n#  Change parms to fit your needs.\n\ninsmod /boot/grub/x86_64-efi/cat\nif rmmod -v cat; then set SB\u003d1; fi\n#echo SB\u003d$SB; sleep -v 8\nif [ $SB \u003d\u003d 1 ]; then\n   linux  /boot/syslinux/vmlinuz $porteus_parms\n   initrd /boot/syslinux/initrd.xz\n   boot\n   exit\nfi\nchainloader $efibootmgr\nboot\nexit\n\n```\n\nThe \"home\" missing error I was getting previously was due to no home.mod module in the /boot/grub/x86_64-efi folder. So I changed the name to a file that does exist. But the various config options I tried with insmod and rmmod failed. One senario was the Secure Boot code was being executed in both Secure Boot and disabled Secure Boot mode. Not a bad scenario, just not the desired scenario.\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n```\nguest@porteus:~$ tree /mnt/sdb1 -d\n/mnt/sdb1\n├── EFI\n│   ├── Porteusboot\n│   └── boot\n\n├── boot\n│   ├── docs\n│   ├── grub\n│   │   └── x86_64-efi\n│   └── syslinux\n├── changes\n└── porteus\n    ├── base\n    ├── modules\n    ├── optional\n    └── rootcopy\n```\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n**Edited by 911CD.net, 29 November 2018 - 07:17 PM.**\n"

I can reduce the size of VHD to 512 MB and it will be loaded in half time + the time to reach desktop. But to me it doesn\u0027t seems excesive as it is now.\n\nOf course there are many factors involved here, the USB device reading speed, the CPU speed and Ram speed, so every case will be unique.\n\nBut from another device, an Adata UV100 USB 2.0 stick with 2 partitions (only empty stick avilable at the time) I have no problem to Ramboot the VHD and it works flawlessly once loaded on Ram but of course it takes longer to load in Ram, just wanted to confirm on other devices can work fine.\n\n**EDIT:** Fixed some typing mistakes (thanks to **wimb** for find them), please excuse me but it was about 4:00 am in my country when I made the lines this way first time for my menu.lst, and as they worked fine (even with mistakes), just copy paste here and never reviewed them again.\n\nalacran\n\n"

      "content": "Hold your horses.\n\nLet\u0027s debunk these myths at their very start.\n\nThe \"new paradigm\" (re:offset of partitions) is (as often happens with anything MS originated) more myths than anything else.\n\nThe idea of using (as opposed to the head boundary) the 2048 sector for first partition is entirely arbitrary.\n\nWhat was initially a way to have faster access to rotational disks (with - believe me - very little actual gain in terms of speed and only noticeable with database use) became senselessly standard.\n\n**BUT** when it came to SSD\u0027s (or more generally flash based devices) it started to make a lot of sense.\n\nThe first (obvious) advantage (at file system level) is that clusters (usually on NTFS 8 sectors or 4096 bytes) become inherently aligned.\n\nThe second one (specific for flash and solid state devices) is that the page size (which is the actual unit at which some operations are performed on SSD) is also aligned.\n\nThe first one is reached with \\*any\\* multiple of 8 sectors, though usually powers are used (for slightly different reasons) with an offset of 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024 or 2048 sectors BUT the specific SSD (or flash device) may have a internal \"structures\", let\u0027s call them \"page size\" and \"erase block size\" which may (or may not) provide a further slight enhancement, among them, the \"page size\" is actually be a good idea (while aligning to the \"erase block size\" makes little sense).\n\nThese values are (usually but not always) respectively 16 sectors (or 8 kb) and 4096 sectors (256\\*page size).\n\nSome previous related discussion is here:\n\n[http://reboot.pro/to...-memory-drives/](http://reboot.pro/topic/16783-rmprepusb-faster-fat32-write-access-on-flash-memory-drives/ \"\")\n\nSo, in a nutshell an offset to the first NTFS partition volume of:\n\n16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024 or 2048\n\nis \"good\" and there is NO difference in using the one or the other (if the page size is 8 kb)\n\nIf the page size is 16 Kb (or 8 Kb), any of:\n\n32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024 or 2048\n\nis \"good\" and there is NO difference in using the one or the other.\n\nIn practice besides 2048:\n\n64, 128, 256, 512 and 1024\n\nwill \"cover\" page sizes up to 32 Kb in EXACTLY the same manner, and\n\n128, 256, 512 and 1024 will \"cover\" page sizes up to 64 Kb in EXACTLY the same manner.\n\n![:duff:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/duff.gif)\n\nWonko\n\n"

I know ChrisPE uses [AccessGain](http://www.hobeanu.com/accessgain/ \"External link\"), but since you have your own tools to make WinPE\u0027s since long time ago, I think you may have some other candidates we may add to our VHD before wimboot Capture and Install.\n\u003e\nI think [AccessGain](http://www.hobeanu.com/accessgain/ \"External link\") is the way to go and I don\u0027t have another tool for this purpose.\n\n"

Do you have any particular reason for doing it twice? If not, then you may consider doing it this way:\n\nI use to create my first full standard install on VHD from 10 or 15 GB and I have used also expandable VHD only on this first install, (yes now WinNTSetup let you use smaller sizes, some time ago 25 GB was the minimun possible), then on this VHD I install all I will need running on my final OS, and a single wimboot mode capture is enought, and finally a wimboot mode install to VHD is required.\n\nSVBus driver can be added latter on FileDisk booted small wimboot VHD, or could be installed on first Full size VHD and if we want, for some reason, it not compressed latter on our wimboot VHD and (only in this case) just add to your WimBootCompress_BCD.ini on \\[PrepopulateList\\] before capture, as the other you recommed (good idea by the way):\n\n\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\drivers\\\\svbusx64.sys -----\\\u003e This should be the only required (if any).  \n\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\DriverStore\\\\FileRepository\\\\svbus.inf_amd64_de3077296e6085bf\\\\\\* -----\\\u003e I think this is not mandatory, but it do not hurt.\n\nAnd the full section \\[PinningFolderList\\] can be deleted to do not have anymore the warning about Unrecogniced Section: \\[PinningFolderList\\], this section is a new addition on 1809, it do not exists on the WimBootCompress.ini of my running 1709.\n\nAnother comment is select tricks during WinNTSetup install (like disable hibernate and no pagefile) is required only the first time you make an install, since when we capture the OS on the VHD all this is allready done and we do not need to do it againg next time we deploy new captured image, since it is as a Backup image, for that reason I usually run CCleaner and defragment before a capture.\n\nBest Regards\n\nalacran\n\n"

And I can say karyonix command is very clear and easy to remember and it works fantastic on my tests on 10 VHDs.\n\nThis is a winner:\n\n```\ntitle win.vhd map next to last hd\nfind --set-root --ignore-floppies /win.vhd\nmap --mem --top /win.vhd (hd)\nmap --hook\nroot (hd-1,0)\nchainloader /bootmgr\n```\n\nBest Regards\n\nalacran  \n\n#### Attached Thumbnails {#attach_wrap}\n\n* [![10 VHD on internal HD.png](http://reboot.pro/uploads/monthly_03_2019/post-26560-0-33622000-1552394425_thumb.png)](http://reboot.pro/uploads/monthly_03_2019/post-26560-0-33622000-1552394425.png \"10 VHD on internal HD.png - Size: 25.54KB\"){#ipb-attach-url-16504-0-88568700-1676066389}\n* [![10 VHD on external HD.png](http://reboot.pro/uploads/monthly_03_2019/post-26560-0-01807900-1552394442_thumb.png)](http://reboot.pro/uploads/monthly_03_2019/post-26560-0-01807900-1552394442.png \"10 VHD on external HD.png - Size: 26.21KB\"){#ipb-attach-url-16505-0-88577900-1676066389}\n\n"

Boot from USB with **AIO Boot** - previous Integration of Linux ISO generates Grub4dos and Grub2 menu entries\n\nMethod 2 and 3 are useful in case menu entry for method 1 is not (yet) available, but otherwise method 1 is preferred\n\nAt MSFN there is topic [USB Format Tool and UEFI_MULTI](https://msfn.org/board/topic/181311-usb-format-tool-and-uefi_multi/ \"External link\")\n\nAll my projects are now available for Download as Releases at [wimb GitHub](https://github.com/wimbrts \"External link\")\n\n**Download:** [USB_FORMAT](https://github.com/wimbrts/USB_FORMAT/releases \"External link\") and [UEFI_MULTI](https://github.com/wimbrts/UEFI_MULTI/releases \"External link\") and [VHD_WIMBOOT](https://github.com/wimbrts/VHD_WIMBOOT/releases \"External link\") and [System_Info](https://github.com/wimbrts/System_Info/releases \"External link\") and [MBR_Backup](https://github.com/wimbrts/MBR_Backup/releases \"External link\")\n\n![:cheers:](https://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif)\n\n"
