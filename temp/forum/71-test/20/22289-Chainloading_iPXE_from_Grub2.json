(it\u0027s just stuck there)\n\nchainloader /snponly.efi\n\nboot\n\nno more network device\n\nI checked the interface in grub before the chainloader to make sure it works. i also tried to chainload grub2 with grub2 to test if it was an issue with ipxe but same results, no interface after chainloading.\n\nAnyone know what I\u0027m doing wrong?\n\n"
