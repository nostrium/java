Correct?  \n\u003e\n\u003e How do you make a VHD file contiguous?\n\nYes, the difference will be only the time required to load to Ram the VHD.\n\nYes, once loaded to Ram then all will be done on Ram, and only limited by SVBus driver speed, with the only exception of Wimboot mode installation, where there is still the need to read info from the linked WIM file located on a drive outside of the VHD.\n\nIf a VHD file is created as fixed size, it will be contiguous, but if it is created expandable, very possible it will not be contiguous, to make it contiguous we can use Wincontig and/or Defraggler and defragment the **VHD file** if required, of course it is also a good practice to also defragment the content of the VHD when booting from it or when attached.\n\n[grub4dos 0.46a for MBR](http://dl.grub4dos.chenall.net/grub4dos-0.4.6a-2020-08-09.7z \"External link\") works very fine on fixed size or expandable VHDs, it is said it theoretically supports to work with a file with upto 64 fragments, but other people say in real life the limit is 32 fragments.\n\nExpandable VHDs load faster on Ram than fixed size VHDs.\n\n[lz4 compressor](http://reboot.pro/index.php?app\u003ddownloads\u0026showfile\u003d612 \"\") (Valid for grub4dos 0.46a for MBR and grub4dos for UEFI) lz4 compressed VHDs load faster on Ram than expandable VHDs, but this only apply to fixed size VHDs, expandable VHDs lz4 compressed DO NOT boot.\n\nalacran\n\n"
