I never knew. What\u0027s interesting is this is possible with DOS system tools. The first bootable stick I made I did with a DOS USB driver, Win98 DOS fdisk, format, and sys.com. Now it boots up as drive \"C:\" I did this with the Win98 SE tools. I even get the Win98 startup logo. Do you know where that logo lives? The mbr, vbr, io.sys?  \n\nMy desktop PC has trouble booting any bootable stick using the BIOS settings for USB-FDD, USB-HDD, or USB-ZIP (Award I think), but it works fine when the stick acts as a HDD then I make it the first drive in the BIOS order, but what a pain. I was going to play with Syslinux and RMPrep to see if I could make a stick that the BIOS would actually use under USB_FDD or ZIP. There are some Syslinux switches.  \n\nMy Dell machines are VERY good at booting any stick made bootable. I know I used Unetbootin to make a stick bootable, but I don\u0027t know if it was a \"superfloppy\" (first) or not.  \n\nI\u0027ll have to get a stick or zero a stick and watch the behavior of Unetbootin again.  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nThis was a good read just now: [http://www.boot-land...?showtopic\u003d4560](http://www.boot-land.net/forums/index.php?showtopic\u003d4560 \"External link\")  \n\n\u003e Under Linux, this is possible with \"system tools\".  \n\u003e Under NT based systems up to XP/2003 this is NOT possible with \"system tools\" (due to the \"Removable bit\", it becomes possible using a filter driver or \"flipping the bit\").  \n\u003e Starting from Vista :)/7 this should be possible with Diskpart.  \n\u003e\n\u003e The good news are that once the stick has a MBR and a partition table all NT based systems will be able to \"deal with it\" properly (at least for first, active partition).  \n\u003e\n\u003e The bad news are that a number of BIOS will have problems with these sticks partitioned with \"standard tools\".  \n\u003e\n\u003e All the recommended utilities have different ( ADDITIONAL to the standard tools) settings/tricks/code/whatever to attempt being able to boot to a wider number of systems.  \n\u003e\n\u003e So, if you mean that Unetbootin can make bootable a partitioned stick, you are correct.\n\nI suppose that must have been my experience, not knowing about the superfloppy.   \n\nDoesn\u0027t Syslinux also create a partition table? I will have to investigate. Perhaps I will zero out a stick and find out exactly what is going on here.  \n\nThis thread was cut from another one so, and it has been a while since I read the initial list, I will revisit.  \n\n\u003e I do agree Unetbootin has a very specific purpose, however it does seem the author intended  \n\u003e But since most (please read as 99.999%) sticks will come as NOT partitioned, it WON\u0027T make them bootable, or, to be more exact, it WON\u0027T make them bootable as HD-like device, a setting that roughly 97.86% of motherboards **need** and that 99.83% of the Tutorials you can find here also ***need*** .  \n\u003e\n\u003e So, if you have ALL your motherboards in the 2.14% range AND you plan to use on the baran new stick ONLY the 0.17% of tutorials/guides/methods you can find on boot-land, you are very welcome to use Unetbootin ONLY.\n\nWell, I would never use Unetbootin only, not when there is RMPrep. The right tool for the job and all of that. As I said I seemed to think it would make the stick HD-like. Hmm.  \n\n\u003e If you check the screenshots, you will see that in examples the target is eithe D:\\\\ under windows or /dev/sdc1 under Linux, in other words, Unetbootin deals with \\\\\\\\.\\\\LogicalDrive and NOT with \\\\\\\\.\\\\PhysicalDrives, or if you prefer with Volumes and NOT with Disks.  \n\u003e\n\u003e If using a \"normal\" stick, you will find yourself with a perfectly bootable with syslinux/isolinux volume ![:D](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/biggrin.png) , that your BIOS will NOT be able to boot ![:D](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/biggrin.png) (NOT always, but in about 97.86% of cases :smile:).  \n\u003e\n\u003e \u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e \u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e :smile:  \n\u003e Wonko\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nAha very true about the logical drive.   \n\nSince I don\u0027t have the scope yet of all of this, are there some tools that use the nomenclature you wrote here: \\\\\\\\.\\\\Logical \\\\\\\\.\\\\Physical ??  \n\nThanks!  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n:wink:  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nbreaker  \n\nEDIT: msdos.sys is a text file in 98.... :smile:   \n\n**Edited by breaker, 27 November 2010 - 07:15 AM.**\n"
