(same with v2020-12-13 and v2020-12-15).\n\nBut if I boot fron any of both loaders and chainload to the other then the 2.3 GB VHD do not load to Ram.\n\nSame behaviour is present if booting from internal HD, I didn\u0027t noticed it before, as I created with BootIce an entry for Grub2 Super UEFI and another for UEFI grub4dos, I was booting from one or the other to test, and just chainloaded to the other to see occasionally the respective menu on screen only, but never tested trying to boot from the second loader, after chainload to it.\n\nBy the way I formated the USB FAT-32 partition and by means of UEFI_MULTI all boot files/folders were created again, but this time selected Mint UEFI and I noticed UEFI_MULTI writes fine the info to both menu.lst but it writes to /grub/grub.cfg the line to load/run G4E and it should be done to /boot/grub/grub.cfg, I edited it manually to call G4E from it, and the menu.lst appear on screen but same thing with all 2.3 GB VHDs\n\nIf booting with G4E those 2.3 GB VHDs can Ramboot with or without --top parameter, so this means there is enough contiguous Ram to load them below or above 4 GB, tested this when G4E is the second loader trying yo Ramboot the 2.3 GB VHDs and got the not enough Ram message in both cases.\n\nIt seems like when one of the loaders runs it is writen on the Ram below 4 GB and the other is writen on the Ram above 4 GB, both in the worst location, as then there is not enought contiguous Ram to load the 2.3 GB VHDs on this PC with 8 GB of Ram. Because the Mini-10-UEFI-WB.vhd of 1.1 GB MBR (FAT32 64 MB + rest NTFS) Ramboots fine from whichever is the second loader, confirming this that the biggest chunk, of free contiguous space available on Ram is smaller than 2.3 GB, on this PC with 8 GB of Ram.\n\nalacran\n\n"

      "content": "Hi, a few quick questions - I\u0027ve prepared a bootable SDHC card using USB_FORMAT and then added to bootmgr WinPE stubs by Bootice.\n\nIt boots fine to these environments with some limitations which I\u0027d wish to resolve:\n\n- If the card is plugged into regular USB socket via adapter, the multi-boot is made, but if plugged into built-in laptop SD reader, the boot stucks. I\u0027ve verified in BIOS that in boot order USB device precedes HDD and BIOS sees the SDcard. Would the \"Allow fixed USB drive\" option remove this limitation?\n\n- not bootable to Parted Magic. As I notice there\u0027s pre-created folder /iso/pmagic/, but simply copying pmagic_XXXX_XX_XX.iso there doesn\u0027t make it appear in the submenu of \"Portable Linux Distro\", should the ISO be placed to different location, or registered explicitly into grub config files?\n\n- can\u0027t fit Windows 11 install media. As USB_FORMAT forces FAT32 filesystem, it can\u0027t fit files above 4GB. How could I change the format to exFAT/NTFS if acceptable, or perhaps extract the install.esd stub (\\\u003c4GB) from ISO and make it bootable directly?\n\n- why USB_FORMAT doesnot allow Add VHD to Boot Manager option, can I add it ex-post?\n\n**Edited by Franz Ferdinand II., 09 April 2022 - 09:15 AM.**\n"

You need explicitly allow this ....\n\nBooting from SD reader can be more difficult. I suggest to use F8 [Hotkey Boot Menu](https://www.disk-image.com/faq-bootmenu.htm \"External link\")\n\nFor Parted Magic ISO there is not yet a preconfigured entry in grub_Linux.cfg or in menu_Linux.lst . You have got to make such entry.\n\nThe Win11 ISO file can be located on NTFS partition and After booting with PE boot.wim from USB the ISO can be used by WinNTSetup for Install of Win11\n\nUSB_FORMAT makes boot entry for Fixed Filename Mini-10x64.vhd\n\nAny other VHD can be Added later to Boot Manager Menu by using [UEFI_MULTI](https://github.com/wimbrts/UEFI_MULTI/releases \"External link\")\n\n"
