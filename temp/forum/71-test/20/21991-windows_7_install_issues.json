And if you want it for gaming Video driver is mandatory.\n\nBut it seems your equipment has an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050, so there should be no problem once you install the Win7 drivers.\n\nalacran\n\n"

Where it says 7. enjoy it with full fucntion works. Or do i go with the whole entire guide?\n\nUsing the Hex editor i was confused with him saying modify the follwing bytes \"modify the following two bytes into\"\n\nAll i did was find was used the find feature  \n**83 F8 13 75 43 F7 42 04 00 00 00 02**\n\n**and**\n\n****01 76 17 83 F9 13 75 44 F7 42 04 00 00 00 02****\n\nand then used its feature to replace both of them with 90 90, is that how it works?\n\nI might be right in how i did it, but never harms to ask.\n\n[https://i.postimg.cc...7wB/Capture.png](https://i.postimg.cc/VvNPc7wB/Capture.png \"External link\")\n\nMy second issue, is the sigining driver guide. Im completley lost with it.\n\nSo i make a folder called driver cert as the guide asks, i also download the sdk.\n\nBut when ever i put in the second line of code it tells me i never found it\n\n"

If you have 2 hdd, copy the necesarry files on the 2nd, the 1st gets formatted.  \n\u003e\n\u003e You don\u0027t have to rename any file from the graphics folder of the intel driver, therefore no xg20gr.inf, leave the intel driver file how it is.  \n\u003e\n\u003e Don\u0027t forget to export the certificate from the virtual machine (after you installed it) using regedit. You do that using my link from my first post, that one from stack exchange. Then you have to mount the corresponding path of the registry hive from your windows 7 installation on windows 10 pen edition.  \n\u003e\n\u003e I\u0027ll write a guide soon because it seems not so clear from now on.\n\nIm confussed now with what your saying, a guide would be pretty useful.\n\nSo what your saying is i just install windows 7 on a machine (not a vm) that can run it, witch i have my dell laptop, install the uhd drivers witch we have just edited on the os, along with the certificate roots.\n\nThen switch back the hard drive to the nitro 5, enter windows pe with a windows 10 boot stick, and install the certificate or that way?\n\n**Edited by popoof22, 08 May 2019 - 06:19 AM.**\n"

It may be installing but could take hours. Is it possible you could upload your wim and bootmfgw files to google drive?\n\nAlso must their be certen options disabled in bios? I didnt disable xhci and its to do with the usb 3 ports and everything (not that i ever used the usb 3 port tho)\n\nAlso command promts, i dont have to spifically open them anywhere? I just open command promt as admin from the desktop as normal right? Because windows mini gives you option to open command promt from an usb or drive, would i need to open certen commands from them?\n\nYou had also asked for the model of my nitro 5, its the one with the i5 8300k, the gtx 1050 4gbs vram, i forget the model name or what ever it is.\n\n**Edited by popoof22, 16 May 2019 - 07:47 PM.**\n"

To do this, I had to set a supervisor bios password, otherwise I couldnt modify that. Then you can remove the supervisor password if you want.

      "content": "\u003e Everything done perfectly. The only thing I saw is that the \"bootmgfw.efi\" file you use has the same size as the one that gets overwritten. Did you get this file from a Windows 10 ISO as I said? Anyway, try with the file I used from my original Windows 10 on my Acer laptop: [https://openload.co/...6g/bootmgfw.efi](https://openload.co/f/gHMa3CXSf6g/bootmgfw.efi \"External link\")\n\u003e\n\u003e And after the reboot, you must wait again for a while with black screen, the installation continues this way and only after a while you will get \"checking system performance\" on the screen. Do not power off the laptop manually, leave it alone for a long while.\n\u003e\n\u003e I don\u0027t know if your efi file is wrong, just use mine and further do it as you did, all commands are working fine (even if the one with set services doesn\u0027t have any confirmation, it really works otherwise the following lines would not succeed). Then after reboot leave it alone for a while, it can take a long time until it passes the black screen. I have a SSD and it takes long, you have a HDD and it would take longer.\n\u003e\n\u003e Hopefully it works, otherwise I honestly have no idea what we could try!\n\nIll try with the one given, i used the boot mgfw from the slimed install.wim.\n\n**Edited by popoof22, 28 May 2019 - 05:42 AM.**\n"

The only thing i managed to bring up is a selection where you can choose an operating system. You can pick 7 but the screen will go blank again. However you can press f8 and do some boot options.\n\nI tried doing safe mode, and it freezes vga.pnp. Before when a while ago when i tried installing 7 via just a usb, trying to do it i tried the f8 options, and it would also freeze, i think its the same issue where you would try to normally boot windows 7 off a usb where the orbs would freeze. So it might all be the same driver issue.\n\nIf you have anything to update me on the situation please let me know.\n\nAlso so we could get more direct messages faster would you like to join my discord server? if you have a account.\n\n**Edited by popoof22, 29 May 2019 - 08:53 AM.**\n"

This 2014 version works perfectly on a standard laptop.  \n\u003e\n\u003e Turn on xchi and use sata with optane. If not working, try different combinations. Also don\u0027t forget to use my efi file which is a Windows 10 efi file. If you get reboot, that\u0027s good, it means the driver is loaded, after reboot you have to wait very much until you get \"checking device performance\" (30min should be enough).\nYou mean when it rebots you must wait 30 minutes till checking device performence?   \n\n**Edited by popoof22, 03 June 2019 - 07:10 AM.**\n"

I\u0027ll have a look these days and I will send you the same driver for 8.1. For 8.1 you also need secure boot off and also driver signing off with F8. Remember you have to go to device manager and update the driver manually, do not use the included setup of the driver. Tell me what message you get (or print screen could be good) when using the driver you made for 8.1 with secure boot off and driver signing verification off.   \n\nThe guys from the other forum used the nonsigned version of the driver, therefore they had to use F8 option to disable driver verification.

Im trying to hook up my gamecube controller to dolphin, using the smash bros wii u port thingy, is their any drivers i would need to install for that?\n\nIf theirs any specific drivers ill be sure to send them to you\n\nIll have a search for blue touth drivers too\n\n"

Then you already have an empty C drive for windows and an empty S drive for the EFI, then follow the guide. Meanwhile you have everything sitting in D.  \n\nIf you ever plan to reinstall, when creating the first partition with ntfs you can specify \"size\u003d\" in MB, so 20GB in MB would be 20x1024+1\u003d20481MB, always use this formula to get perfectly rounded size, otherwise you get 19,9GB.   \n\nEasier is using external hdd, backup what you need and start over.  \n\nFurther you cannot just move installed apps and stuff from one installation to another.
