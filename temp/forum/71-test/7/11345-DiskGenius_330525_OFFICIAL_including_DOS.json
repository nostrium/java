The software will always start the grace period by 0. No matter how often you\u0027ve already used it. This would not be possible on a real XP, unless the registry is thoroughly cleaned.  \nIs resetting or cleaning the registry allowed?

You\u0027re trying to circumvent the question of the legality of the automatic push of a button, by declaring it the same problem as ripping off the author and thereby making it illegal.   \n\nI don\u0027t know if i\u0027m the exception or not, but i don\u0027t spend time finding freeware replacements for software that i like. I spend time finding the best suited software for my needs and don\u0027t care about free-, share-, or buyware.  \nBut even though i pay the \u0027author\u0027, that does not mean, that i don\u0027t hack the software.   \nMost commonly i fix labels of buttons, remove - or add buttons to the toolbar or just plain reorder them. Another favorite of mine is, to fix a program so that the default options are my options. That prevents troubles with the program forgetting my prefered settings.  \nSo while not ripping the author off, i definitly do something against his will.  \n\nSo you see going against authors will and ripping him off, are two seperate things which can happen together, but do not have to.  \n\nWould probably be interesting to know what the individual authors prefer, getting paid for the software and me hacking it, or me not buying and using it.   \n\n\u003e In case you missed it, the topic was that of a \"good\" program Author, which was kind enough to release his apps with a \"grace\" period of FULL functionality, with a small reminder that if you use his software you should pay for it, nothing connected to malware, instaaling drivers or whatever else.\nAren\u0027t you a little old to still classify things as good and bad? There is not good and no bad. Every soldier killing another soldier on the battlefield is always regarded a hero by his peoples and a villian by the opposite peoples.  \n\nSoftware is eighter useful **to you** or not.   \nYour personal opinion about a piece of software, should however not influence your opinion on the subject in general.  \nMaking up different rules for identical things, upon personal preferences, has always been proven to be a bad idea.   \nSee for instance treating people differently based on gender, skin color, religion, ......  \n\n\u003e And yes, most people, given the means to save money without any consequence, nor nag, will attempt to do it.\nNow i\u0027m confused. Do you believe that people will use the program as freebee once the nag screen is removed or do you believe that they will use the program as freebee regardless.   \nCause if the later and it sure sounds that way, then i understand even less, why you\u0027re trying to connect the automatic pushing of a button to the illegal use of the program.  \n\n![:cheers:](https://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif)   \n"

You\u0027re trying to circumvent the question of the legality of the automatic push of a button, by declaring it the same problem as ripping off the author and thereby making it illegal.   \n\nI don\u0027t know if i\u0027m the exception or not, but i don\u0027t spend time finding freeware replacements for software that i like. I spend time finding the best suited software for my needs and don\u0027t care about free-, share-, or buyware.  \nBut even though i pay the \u0027author\u0027, that does not mean, that i don\u0027t hack the software.   \nMost commonly i fix labels of buttons, remove - or add buttons to the toolbar or just plain reorder them. Another favorite of mine is, to fix a program so that the default options are my options. That prevents troubles with the program forgetting my prefered settings.  \nSo while not ripping the author off, i definitly do something against his will.  \n\nSo you see going against authors will and ripping him off, are two seperate things which can happen together, but do not have to.  \n\nWould probably be interesting to know what the individual authors prefer, getting paid for the software and me hacking it, or me not buying and using it.   \n\n\u003e In case you missed it, the topic was that of a \"good\" program Author, which was kind enough to release his apps with a \"grace\" period of FULL functionality, with a small reminder that if you use his software you should pay for it, nothing connected to malware, instaaling drivers or whatever else.\nAren\u0027t you a little old to still classify things as good and bad? There is not good and no bad. Every soldier killing another soldier on the battlefield is always regarded a hero by his peoples and a villian by the opposite peoples.  \n\nSoftware is eighter useful **to you** or not.   \nYour personal opinion about a piece of software, should however not influence your opinion on the subject in general.  \nMaking up different rules for identical things, upon personal preferences, has always been proven to be a bad idea.   \nSee for instance treating people differently based on gender, skin color, religion, ......  \n\n\u003e And yes, most people, given the means to save money without any consequence, nor nag, will attempt to do it.\nNow i\u0027m confused. Do you believe that people will use the program as freebee once the nag screen is removed or do you believe that they will use the program as freebee regardless.   \nCause if the later and it sure sounds that way, then i understand even less, why you\u0027re trying to connect the automatic pushing of a button to the illegal use of the program.  \n\n![:cheers:](https://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif)   \n"
