      "content": "I have 2 separate questions and would appreciate your advice:  \n\n1) I have a bootable CD for Acronis Boot Agent. I want to create a bootable partition on my PC/Laptop, from a bootable CD (containing this Acronis Boot Agent). I am trying to achieve the following; When the bootloader / boot manager loads up, it should give me the options to (1) Boot from Windows 7 (2) Boot to Acronis Boot Agent  \n\nSo my question is, how can I setup a new partition on my hard drive which would contain the CD image of my Acronis Boot Agent, so that I no longer need to boot from my CD ? Also, how do I setup my loot loader/boot manager with this option to boot from this special bootable partition ? Which tool would support this and how would I set this up ?  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n2) Also, does anyone know of a way to boot from an ISO image file stored on your hard drive ? Similar to question #1 above, except here I want my boot loader/boot manager/boot menu to give me the option to boot from an ISO image file stored on my hard drive. Again, is this possible ? Which tool would I need to use, and how would I achieve this ?   \n\nThanks for all your help !   \n"

(if you survive the experience, of course ![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif))  \n\nGenerally this kind of tutorials, just like batches, are made to \"replicate\" things, whilst articles, manuals and threads are made to exchange ideas and info and ultimately to \"learn\" things, in other words with tutorials you usually learn \"what\" to do as opposed to \"why\" and \"how\" you need to do it.  \n\nIf you want to \\*learn\\* \"how it works\" read the guide:  \n[http://diddy.boot-la...os/Grub4dos.htm](http://diddy.boot-land.net/grub4dos/Grub4dos.htm \"External link\")  \nand the stickies in the grub4dos Forum:  \n[http://www.boot-land...hp?showforum\u003d66](http://www.boot-land.net/forums/index.php?showforum\u003d66 \"External link\")  \nthen experiment (and possibly report your experience)  \n\n![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif)  \nWonko   \n"
