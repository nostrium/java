NO.  \n\nWe have now two very good RAMDISK drivers (firadisk and WinVblock) that can \"hook\" a ramdisk presented by grub4dos or Syslinux.  \n\nActually building a \"real\" XP totally in RAM, while possible, as it has been demonstrated by Euhenio some time ago, is not very easy.  \n\nLuckily enough, there is now a partially automated builder:  \n[http://www.boot-land...?...ic\u003d9830\\\u0026hl\u003d](http://www.boot-land.net/forums/index.php?showtopic\u003d9830\u0026hl\u003d \"External link\")  \n\nStart from it, possibly using a USB stick as media, take your time to get the hang of it \"as-is\", before introducing variations you may need.  \n\n![:thumbsup:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/thumbsup.gif)  \nWonko   \n"
