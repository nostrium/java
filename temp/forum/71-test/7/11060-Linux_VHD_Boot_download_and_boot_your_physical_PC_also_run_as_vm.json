      "content": "1 Linux as Real Appliance  \n\nWith VBoot for Linux, you can pre-install and pre-configure Linux OS and its applications, then distribute the resulting virtual disk file in VHD format. The vhd can boot a real computer, with configuration and apps instantly available. This way, operating systems are truly manageable, as simple as files. We call such a Linux VHD to be a real appliance, in the sense that it boots physical computers.  \n\nIt\u0027s very easy to setup and boot a computer with a vhd file. You download the vhd file, drop it to Windows or Linux file system, then configure the boot loader, and reboot the computer.  \n\n2 Linux as Virtual Appliance  \n\nThe exact same vhd file also runs as a virtual machine using virtualization software, such as VMLite Workstation, VirtualBox, Xen and Virtual PC and Hyper-V, etc. By default, it\u0027s optimized for VMLite Workstation.   \n\nIf VMLite Workstation is installed, you can simply double click the ubuntu-910-desktop-i386.mop file to launch the vhd as a virtual machine with VMLite Workstation.   \n\nA sample Ubuntu VHD package is ready for download:  \n\n[http://www.vmlite.co...d/22-appliances](http://www.vmlite.com/index.php/download/22-appliances \"External link\") (free site registration required)  \n\ndownload, extract it, then double click setup.exe on Windows, reboot  \nOn Linux, need to configure boot loaders.  \n\ndetailed instructions:  \n\n[http://www.vmlite.co...910-readme.html](http://www.vmlite.com/appliances/ubuntu-910-readme.html \"External link\")  \n\nscreenshot:  \n\n[http://www.vmlite.co...vboot-grub2.png](http://www.vmlite.com/images/vboot/vboot-grub2.png \"External link\")  \n\n- VMLite Team   \n"

      "content": "The following are some instructions from the readme.html file:  \n\n//////////////////////////////////////////////  \nVMLite VBoot - Linux VHD Boot  \nupdated on Apr-09-10  \n\nCopyright Â© 2010, VMLite Inc.  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n1.3 The sample Ubuntu VHD  \nThe sample ubuntu-910-desktop-i386.vhd is a pre-installed 32-bit Ubuntu 9.10 desktop version in English.  \n\nself growing disk with disk capacity of 100G, with initial size about 3G  \n\nroot username/password: user/welcome  \n\n2 System Requirements   \nWindows 2000 and Later, 32- and 64- bit, NTFS file system  \n\nLinux with GRUB, GRUB2 or other compatible boot loaders, 32- and 64- bit  \n\nMac - to be supported soon  \n\n4G disk space  \n\n3 Download and Extract  \nThe sample Ubuntu 9.10 package is a few hundred MB, so it will take quite some time to download, and it\u0027s recommended to use a download manager, such as FlashGet.   \n\nOnce download is complete, first you need to extract the file, which is in .7z format. More info can be found at [http://www.7-zip.org/download.html](http://www.7-zip.org/download.html \"External link\"). On Windows, you can use WinRar or 7Zip to extract the file. On Linux, you can use the following commands to install 7zip, and unzip the file:  \n\nsudo apt-get install p7zip  \n\np7zip -d ubuntu-910.7z  \n\nIn order to boot a computer using the vhd file, make sure that it\u0027s not extracted to a network drive, or to another virtual disk. The vhd file must reside in a basic volume on internal or external hard disks (e.g., USB drives), otherwise, it won\u0027t boot.  \n\n4 Install on Windows  \nIf your current host is Windows, you need to install VBoot loader, and add a boot entry to Windows boot manager. In addition, you need to tell VBoot where to find the vhd file.  \n\n4.1 Automatic Setup by running setup.exe  \nIt\u0027s highly recommend that you use this method to setup VBoot on Windows, since it\u0027s extremely simple and automates everything. You simply double click setup.exe on 32-bit Windows, or setup64.exe on 64-bit Windows. The setup utility will install VBoot Loader, and configure the Windows boot loader to contain an entry to boot the Linux VHD.  \n\nAfter setup.exe is successfully run, you reboot the computer, and you should see a \"VBoot - Ubuntu VHD Boot\" entry as the last one, select this entry to boot to Linux.  \n\n4.2 Manual Setup  \nIf somehow the automatic setup doesn\u0027t work, then you can perform the following manual steps:  \n\n4.2.1 Copy VBoot Loader Files  \n\nThe VBoot loader is based on GNU GRUB2, and its files are located in vboot sub directory.   \n\nvbootldr.mbr and vbootldr are the two critical boot loader files that must be copied to the root directory of a drive, typical C:\\\\.   \nThe fonts directory contains font files to be used by our boot loader.   \nThe grub directory contains grub2 modules, and the very import grub.cfg configuration file.   \nFor example, if you want to copy the files to C:\\\\, you need to copy the vboot directory to c:\\\\, so you will have c:\\\\vboot directory. Then you must copy vbootldr.mbr and vbootldr to c:\\\\.   \n\nThe following commands can be used to copy the files. Make sure to run from the extracted dir.  \n\nmd c:\\\\vboot  \nxcopy /s vboot c:\\\\vboot  \ncopy vboot\\\\vbootldr c:\\\\  \ncopy vboot\\\\vbootldr.mbr c:\\\\  \n\n4.2.2 Configure grub.cfg  \n\nA sample grub.cfg file is placed in c:\\\\vboot\\\\grub directory (or d:\\\\vboot\\\\grub depending on where you have copied the files). This is the GRUB2 configuratrion file to load operating systems. Inside this file, the vhd file path is hard coded, and thus you have to modify it.  \n\ngrub.cfg is a text file that you can use notepad to open and modify. The relevant portion is shown below:  \n\nmenuentry \"VHD Ubuntu, Linux 2.6.31-14-generic\" {  \ninsmod vhd  \nvhd vhd0 (hd0,1)/ubuntu-910/ubuntu-910-desktop-i386.vhd --partitions  \nlinux (vhd0,1)/boot/vmlinuz-2.6.31-14-generic root\u003d/dev/sda1 vloop\u003d/ubuntu-910/ubuntu-910-desktop-i386.vhd quiet splash  \ninitrd (vhd0,1)/boot/initrd.img-2.6.31-14-generic-vboot  \n}  \n\nmenuentry groups a specific operating system. The first line insmod vhd inserts our vhd.mod module to the boot loader. vhd.mod is a GRUB2 module that treats a vhd file as hard disk, and allows GRUB2 to read files from the vhd. For example, the Linux kernel and initrd are loaded from the vhd file, as configured above.  \n\nThere are three paths (as shown in red) related to the vhd file that you need to change depending on the directory to which the vhd file is extracted.  \n\nThe vhd path (hd0,1)/ubuntu-910/ubuntu-910-desktop-i386.vhd is in GRUB2 format where (hd0,1) indicates hard disk 0 and partition 1, with the rest is the absolute path in UNIX format. For example, if your vhd file is inside a folder called 123 on an external USB disk, then you need to change this path to something like (hd1,1)/123/ubuntu-910-desktop-i386.vhd. The path immediately after vloop\u003d should be the same absolute path without the disk number and partition number.  \n\nThe root path is the Linux device name for the disk where the vhd file resides. The number is the partition number, and the letter \u0027a\u0027, \u0027b\u0027, \u0027c\u0027, etc, represents which disk. For (hd0,1), the name would be /dev/sda1; For (hd1,1), it would be /dev/sdb1; For (hd2,4), it would be /dev/sdc4, etc.  \n\n44.2.3 Configure Windows Boot Loader  \n\nOnce VBoot Loader and the vhd file are ready, you need to configure Windows boot manager, so you can boot to the Linux VHD. You need to append the vbootldr.mbr entry to the \\[operating systems\\] section. The following is sample boot.ini file with VBoot entry added at the very last. Shown in red is what you need to add to boot.ini. Change C: to whatever drive you have copied VBoot Loader files.  \n\n\\[boot loader\\]  \ntimeout\u003d30  \ndefault\u003dmulti(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)\\\\WINDOWS  \n\\[operating systems\\]  \nmulti(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)\\\\WINDOWS\u003d\"Microsoft Windows XP Professional\" /noexecute\u003doptin /fastdetect  \nC:\\\\vbootldr.mbr\u003d\"VBoot - Ubuntu VHD Boot\"  \n\n4.2.3.2 Windows Vista/2008/7  \nWindows Vista and above use a different mechanism other than boot.init to boot, and you need to run bcdedit.exe to make changes to the boot manager. The following are the commands to run if you have copied VBoot Loader to drive C:. You must rum these commands as Administrator. Go to Windows Start menu \\\u003e All Programs \\\u003e Accessories, then right click on \"Command Prompt\", then select \"Run As Administrator\". Once command prompt window is open, you can enter these commands.  \n\nbcdedit /create {D3DCE997-7447-41FC-9740-A8D20EE3BF55} /d \"Ubuntu VHD Boot\" /application BOOTSECTOR  \nbcdedit /set {D3DCE997-7447-41FC-9740-A8D20EE3BF55} device partition\u003dC:  \nbcdedit /set {D3DCE997-7447-41FC-9740-A8D20EE3BF55} path \\\\vbootldr.mbr  \nbcdedit /displayorder {D3DCE997-7447-41FC-9740-A8D20EE3BF55} /addlast  \nbcdedit /timeout 30  \n\n5 Install on Linux  \nOn Linux systems, there is no need to install VBoot Loader. Instead, you only need to add an entry to your current boot loader so the Linux VHD can be booted.  \n\n5.1 Configure GRUB2   \nYou can edit the GRUB2 config file, /boot/grub/grub.cfg, using any text editor, and insert an entry like the following:  \n\nmenuentry \"VHD Ubuntu, Linux 2.6.31-14-generic\" {  \nlinux (hd0,1)/ubuntu-910/vmlinuz-2.6.31-14-generic root\u003d/dev/sda1 vloop\u003d/ubuntu-910/ubuntu-910-desktop-i386.vhd quiet splash  \ninitrd (hd0,1)/ubuntu-910/initrd.img-2.6.31-14-generic-vboot  \n}  \n\nThere are some subtle differences between Linux and Windows host. On Windows where our GRUB2 module,vhd.mod, is available, you can configure GRUB2 to load the Linux kerenl and initrd from the exactly same vhd file, whereas on Linux systems, the kernel and initrd are separate files residing externally. In other words, on Windows, it\u0027s strictly only one vhd file is required; whereas on Linux, 3 files (kernel, initrd, vhd) are required. We will try to make the vhd.mod module to support Linux file system soon.  \n\nObviously, you need to change the paths depending on the directory to which the kernel, initrd and vhd files are extracted.  \n\nThe path (hd0,1) indicates hard disk 0 and partition 1, with the rest is the absolute path in UNIX format. For example, if your vhd file is inside a folder called 123 on an external USB disk, then you need to change this path to something like (hd1,1)/123/ubuntu-910-desktop-i386.vhd. The path immediately after vloop\u003d should be the same absolute path without the disk number and partition number.  \n\nThe root path is the Linux device name for the disk where the vhd file resides. The number is the partition number, and the letter \u0027a\u0027, \u0027b\u0027, \u0027c\u0027, etc, represents which disk. For (hd0,1), the name would be /dev/sda1; For (hd1,1), it would be /dev/sdb1; For (hd2,4), it would be /dev/sdc4, etc.  \n\n5.3 Configure Legacy GRUB   \nFor GRUB 0.97 and similar, you can add an entry to your GRUB config file, /boot/grub/menu.lst, using any text editor, and insert an entry like the following:   \n\ntitle VBoot - Ubuntu VHD Boot  \nkernel /boot/ubuntu-910/vmlinuz-2.6.31-14-generic root\u003d/dev/sda1 vloop\u003d/boot/ubuntu-910/ubuntu-910-desktop-i386.vhd quiet splash  \ninitrd /boot/ubuntu-910/initrd.img-2.6.31-14-generic-vboot  \nquiet   \n\nObviously, you need to adjust the paths according to your own locations for the Linux kernel, initrd and vhd file.  \n\n5.4 Configure other Boot Loaders  \nWe haven\u0027t tested other Linux boot loaders, such as LILO and SYSLINUX, but they may work as well. The important thing is to add vloop\u003d argument to the Linux kernel line:  \n\nroot\u003d/dev/sda1 vloop\u003d/boot/ubuntu-910/ubuntu-910-desktop-i386.vhd  \n\nThe above tells where to locate the vhd file.  \n\nThis is two screenshots:  \n\nXP Boot Loader  \n![Posted Image](http://www.vmlite.com/images/vboot/vboot-xp-loader.png)  \n\nThe VHD boot menu:  \n![Posted Image](http://www.vmlite.com/images/vboot/vboot-grub2.png)   \n"

Or even without using VHD, you can launch a vm from sharing files with the host. I am not sure whether can replace PE, but we are working towards the direction to reduce that the difference between the real machine and virtual machine.

You can live snapshot your host os, boot a snapshot, etc., and run the same OS inside a vm if needed.   \n\nSince we also do application virtualization, so later on, apps will be another mix. still a long way to go !   \n"

      "content": "The following are some instructions from the readme.html file:  \n\n//////////////////////////////////////////////  \nVMLite VBoot - Linux VHD Boot  \nupdated on Apr-09-10  \n\nCopyright Â© 2010, VMLite Inc.  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n1.3 The sample Ubuntu VHD  \nThe sample ubuntu-910-desktop-i386.vhd is a pre-installed 32-bit Ubuntu 9.10 desktop version in English.  \n\nself growing disk with disk capacity of 100G, with initial size about 3G  \n\nroot username/password: user/welcome  \n\n2 System Requirements   \nWindows 2000 and Later, 32- and 64- bit, NTFS file system  \n\nLinux with GRUB, GRUB2 or other compatible boot loaders, 32- and 64- bit  \n\nMac - to be supported soon  \n\n4G disk space  \n\n3 Download and Extract  \nThe sample Ubuntu 9.10 package is a few hundred MB, so it will take quite some time to download, and it\u0027s recommended to use a download manager, such as FlashGet.   \n\nOnce download is complete, first you need to extract the file, which is in .7z format. More info can be found at [http://www.7-zip.org/download.html](http://www.7-zip.org/download.html \"External link\"). On Windows, you can use WinRar or 7Zip to extract the file. On Linux, you can use the following commands to install 7zip, and unzip the file:  \n\nsudo apt-get install p7zip  \n\np7zip -d ubuntu-910.7z  \n\nIn order to boot a computer using the vhd file, make sure that it\u0027s not extracted to a network drive, or to another virtual disk. The vhd file must reside in a basic volume on internal or external hard disks (e.g., USB drives), otherwise, it won\u0027t boot.  \n\n4 Install on Windows  \nIf your current host is Windows, you need to install VBoot loader, and add a boot entry to Windows boot manager. In addition, you need to tell VBoot where to find the vhd file.  \n\n4.1 Automatic Setup by running setup.exe  \nIt\u0027s highly recommend that you use this method to setup VBoot on Windows, since it\u0027s extremely simple and automates everything. You simply double click setup.exe on 32-bit Windows, or setup64.exe on 64-bit Windows. The setup utility will install VBoot Loader, and configure the Windows boot loader to contain an entry to boot the Linux VHD.  \n\nAfter setup.exe is successfully run, you reboot the computer, and you should see a \"VBoot - Ubuntu VHD Boot\" entry as the last one, select this entry to boot to Linux.  \n\n4.2 Manual Setup  \nIf somehow the automatic setup doesn\u0027t work, then you can perform the following manual steps:  \n\n4.2.1 Copy VBoot Loader Files  \n\nThe VBoot loader is based on GNU GRUB2, and its files are located in vboot sub directory.   \n\nvbootldr.mbr and vbootldr are the two critical boot loader files that must be copied to the root directory of a drive, typical C:\\\\.   \nThe fonts directory contains font files to be used by our boot loader.   \nThe grub directory contains grub2 modules, and the very import grub.cfg configuration file.   \nFor example, if you want to copy the files to C:\\\\, you need to copy the vboot directory to c:\\\\, so you will have c:\\\\vboot directory. Then you must copy vbootldr.mbr and vbootldr to c:\\\\.   \n\nThe following commands can be used to copy the files. Make sure to run from the extracted dir.  \n\nmd c:\\\\vboot  \nxcopy /s vboot c:\\\\vboot  \ncopy vboot\\\\vbootldr c:\\\\  \ncopy vboot\\\\vbootldr.mbr c:\\\\  \n\n4.2.2 Configure grub.cfg  \n\nA sample grub.cfg file is placed in c:\\\\vboot\\\\grub directory (or d:\\\\vboot\\\\grub depending on where you have copied the files). This is the GRUB2 configuratrion file to load operating systems. Inside this file, the vhd file path is hard coded, and thus you have to modify it.  \n\ngrub.cfg is a text file that you can use notepad to open and modify. The relevant portion is shown below:  \n\nmenuentry \"VHD Ubuntu, Linux 2.6.31-14-generic\" {  \ninsmod vhd  \nvhd vhd0 (hd0,1)/ubuntu-910/ubuntu-910-desktop-i386.vhd --partitions  \nlinux (vhd0,1)/boot/vmlinuz-2.6.31-14-generic root\u003d/dev/sda1 vloop\u003d/ubuntu-910/ubuntu-910-desktop-i386.vhd quiet splash  \ninitrd (vhd0,1)/boot/initrd.img-2.6.31-14-generic-vboot  \n}  \n\nmenuentry groups a specific operating system. The first line insmod vhd inserts our vhd.mod module to the boot loader. vhd.mod is a GRUB2 module that treats a vhd file as hard disk, and allows GRUB2 to read files from the vhd. For example, the Linux kernel and initrd are loaded from the vhd file, as configured above.  \n\nThere are three paths (as shown in red) related to the vhd file that you need to change depending on the directory to which the vhd file is extracted.  \n\nThe vhd path (hd0,1)/ubuntu-910/ubuntu-910-desktop-i386.vhd is in GRUB2 format where (hd0,1) indicates hard disk 0 and partition 1, with the rest is the absolute path in UNIX format. For example, if your vhd file is inside a folder called 123 on an external USB disk, then you need to change this path to something like (hd1,1)/123/ubuntu-910-desktop-i386.vhd. The path immediately after vloop\u003d should be the same absolute path without the disk number and partition number.  \n\nThe root path is the Linux device name for the disk where the vhd file resides. The number is the partition number, and the letter \u0027a\u0027, \u0027b\u0027, \u0027c\u0027, etc, represents which disk. For (hd0,1), the name would be /dev/sda1; For (hd1,1), it would be /dev/sdb1; For (hd2,4), it would be /dev/sdc4, etc.  \n\n44.2.3 Configure Windows Boot Loader  \n\nOnce VBoot Loader and the vhd file are ready, you need to configure Windows boot manager, so you can boot to the Linux VHD. You need to append the vbootldr.mbr entry to the \\[operating systems\\] section. The following is sample boot.ini file with VBoot entry added at the very last. Shown in red is what you need to add to boot.ini. Change C: to whatever drive you have copied VBoot Loader files.  \n\n\\[boot loader\\]  \ntimeout\u003d30  \ndefault\u003dmulti(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)\\\\WINDOWS  \n\\[operating systems\\]  \nmulti(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)\\\\WINDOWS\u003d\"Microsoft Windows XP Professional\" /noexecute\u003doptin /fastdetect  \nC:\\\\vbootldr.mbr\u003d\"VBoot - Ubuntu VHD Boot\"  \n\n4.2.3.2 Windows Vista/2008/7  \nWindows Vista and above use a different mechanism other than boot.init to boot, and you need to run bcdedit.exe to make changes to the boot manager. The following are the commands to run if you have copied VBoot Loader to drive C:. You must rum these commands as Administrator. Go to Windows Start menu \\\u003e All Programs \\\u003e Accessories, then right click on \"Command Prompt\", then select \"Run As Administrator\". Once command prompt window is open, you can enter these commands.  \n\nbcdedit /create {D3DCE997-7447-41FC-9740-A8D20EE3BF55} /d \"Ubuntu VHD Boot\" /application BOOTSECTOR  \nbcdedit /set {D3DCE997-7447-41FC-9740-A8D20EE3BF55} device partition\u003dC:  \nbcdedit /set {D3DCE997-7447-41FC-9740-A8D20EE3BF55} path \\\\vbootldr.mbr  \nbcdedit /displayorder {D3DCE997-7447-41FC-9740-A8D20EE3BF55} /addlast  \nbcdedit /timeout 30  \n\n5 Install on Linux  \nOn Linux systems, there is no need to install VBoot Loader. Instead, you only need to add an entry to your current boot loader so the Linux VHD can be booted.  \n\n5.1 Configure GRUB2   \nYou can edit the GRUB2 config file, /boot/grub/grub.cfg, using any text editor, and insert an entry like the following:  \n\nmenuentry \"VHD Ubuntu, Linux 2.6.31-14-generic\" {  \nlinux (hd0,1)/ubuntu-910/vmlinuz-2.6.31-14-generic root\u003d/dev/sda1 vloop\u003d/ubuntu-910/ubuntu-910-desktop-i386.vhd quiet splash  \ninitrd (hd0,1)/ubuntu-910/initrd.img-2.6.31-14-generic-vboot  \n}  \n\nThere are some subtle differences between Linux and Windows host. On Windows where our GRUB2 module,vhd.mod, is available, you can configure GRUB2 to load the Linux kerenl and initrd from the exactly same vhd file, whereas on Linux systems, the kernel and initrd are separate files residing externally. In other words, on Windows, it\u0027s strictly only one vhd file is required; whereas on Linux, 3 files (kernel, initrd, vhd) are required. We will try to make the vhd.mod module to support Linux file system soon.  \n\nObviously, you need to change the paths depending on the directory to which the kernel, initrd and vhd files are extracted.  \n\nThe path (hd0,1) indicates hard disk 0 and partition 1, with the rest is the absolute path in UNIX format. For example, if your vhd file is inside a folder called 123 on an external USB disk, then you need to change this path to something like (hd1,1)/123/ubuntu-910-desktop-i386.vhd. The path immediately after vloop\u003d should be the same absolute path without the disk number and partition number.  \n\nThe root path is the Linux device name for the disk where the vhd file resides. The number is the partition number, and the letter \u0027a\u0027, \u0027b\u0027, \u0027c\u0027, etc, represents which disk. For (hd0,1), the name would be /dev/sda1; For (hd1,1), it would be /dev/sdb1; For (hd2,4), it would be /dev/sdc4, etc.  \n\n5.3 Configure Legacy GRUB   \nFor GRUB 0.97 and similar, you can add an entry to your GRUB config file, /boot/grub/menu.lst, using any text editor, and insert an entry like the following:   \n\ntitle VBoot - Ubuntu VHD Boot  \nkernel /boot/ubuntu-910/vmlinuz-2.6.31-14-generic root\u003d/dev/sda1 vloop\u003d/boot/ubuntu-910/ubuntu-910-desktop-i386.vhd quiet splash  \ninitrd /boot/ubuntu-910/initrd.img-2.6.31-14-generic-vboot  \nquiet   \n\nObviously, you need to adjust the paths according to your own locations for the Linux kernel, initrd and vhd file.  \n\n5.4 Configure other Boot Loaders  \nWe haven\u0027t tested other Linux boot loaders, such as LILO and SYSLINUX, but they may work as well. The important thing is to add vloop\u003d argument to the Linux kernel line:  \n\nroot\u003d/dev/sda1 vloop\u003d/boot/ubuntu-910/ubuntu-910-desktop-i386.vhd  \n\nThe above tells where to locate the vhd file.  \n\nThis is two screenshots:  \n\nXP Boot Loader  \n![Posted Image](http://www.vmlite.com/images/vboot/vboot-xp-loader.png)  \n\nThe VHD boot menu:  \n![Posted Image](http://www.vmlite.com/images/vboot/vboot-grub2.png)   \n"

Or even without using VHD, you can launch a vm from sharing files with the host. I am not sure whether can replace PE, but we are working towards the direction to reduce that the difference between the real machine and virtual machine.

You should be able to drop Windows VHD to linux, or even Mac host systems, and boot it. We want to provide something that makes the host OS to be managable, just like what you do with a vm today. You can live snapshot your host os, boot a snapshot, etc., and run the same OS inside a vm if needed.   \n\nSince we also do application virtualization, so later on, apps will be another mix. still a long way to go !   \n"
