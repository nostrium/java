      "content": "Hi,  \n\nWe are faced almost on a daily bases with the rolling out company SOE using Norton ghost on to a different hardware laptops and workstations.  \nAs you can imagine it can be very time consuming.   \nCan you please suggest the way to boot to a Windows XP virtual disk (VHD, VDMK or simmilar) from the different hardware platforms.  \nFor some reasons I can\u0027t find a solid solution to this problem, VHD only allows to boot Windows 7 or 2008, VLite Vboot doesn\u0027t support windows xp yet, I\u0027m not even sure about VMware and their solutions.   \nPlease note remote desktop or similar solutions are not the options for us at the moment.  \n\nAt the end of the day what we are looking for is bare metal workstation with the ability to boot to virtual disk with Win XP.  \n\nThank you for your help   \n"
