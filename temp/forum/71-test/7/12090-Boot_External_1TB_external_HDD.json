I am going to try both the methods which your\u0027ll have provided to see if i can get to boot.   \n\nReferring to the question Have you problems in partitioning/formatting/making bootable that hard disk or not?\nI have been able to format the 1TB HDD (ntfs, fat 32) without any problem. Formatting also no problem. Booting i don\u0027t know, as when i try to boot it just doesnt show anything, meaning it goes to the next boot device which is my internal HDD. So maybe something is going wrong with my booting procedure. I tried making the \"Mission Impossible USB\" method following the manual but nothing happened (i couldnt get it to boot). MIUSB on a pendrive worked fine. The same procedure for the 1TB HDD didnt work.  \nNow will try both your methods to check if it works.  \nI also have in my BIOS (Intel DG33 FB motherboard), the option  \nUSB Mass Storage Emulation Type:  \n(1)Auto  \n(2)Removable Disk  \n(3)Fixed Disk  \n(4)Size  \nDefault chosen is: Auto.  \nAlso another option   \nZip Emulation Type:  \n(1)Floppy  \n(2)Hardisk  \nDefault chosen : Floppy  \n\nAnother option Boot USB order.

Than went on to use the \"Mission Impossible USB\" manual procedures and setup WInXP setup, and some of the other iso\u0027s like Linux Mint,Ubuntu, AVG, Partiton Wizard, Hiren, UBCD.  \nNext shutdown PC, removed internal HDD and restarted PC with only 1TB external USB HDD connected. The Intel Boot Agent screen appeared . The Intel Boot Agent exited and a warning came on saying that \"No bootable device is present. Please put bootable device and press enter\" . So i just pressed enter as the 1TB external HDD was already connected at the time of restarting the PC. The moment i pressed enter the MIUSB (menu.lst) splash screen appeared and here i am now inside the Linux Mint OS , firefox web browser which is lying in my 1 TB external HDD. Right now i don\u0027t have my internal HDD connected, it\u0027s only my external 1 TB HDD. Next i used Partition Wizard from the pendrive and repartitioned the 1TB, so that the bootable MIUSB partition is only 50GB, and the rest 880GB is a second logical partition NTFS. So the first Active partiton with the bootable MIUSB is 50 GB (FAT32), and second partition is 880GB(NTFS). There was no problem after the partitioning. Still the first partition booted. So there has been no problem neither when the partition was full 930GB, nor now when the 2 partitions are of 50GB(FAT32) and 880GB(NTFS). It still works fine.  \n\nSo the problem was not with the making of the bootable HDD, it was with the timing of the external HDD not being recognised.  \n\nWish somebody could **help** me figure out how i can **delay the timing** so that the BIOS gets time to recognise the external HDD, so that it doesn\u0027t jump (boot from) for the internal HDD, and instead boots from the 1TB external HDD. Because right now the only way i have managed is by disconnecting the internal HDD.  \nAny suggestions will be great..... ![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif)   \n"

      "content": "Hello  \nThank You so much Wonko The Sane.....i have to salute you for ![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif) making it so easy.   \nSorry for not replying faster, was just going through the PLoP information (at the website) (just incase something had to go wrong).  \nThe 1 TB WD external USB HDD worked from PLoP boot manager (which i have not installed, but have only run from the Windows boot Menu). Had **slight problem** not with the booting of 1 TB, it\u0027s after the MIUSB splash screen comes and i choose to install WIN 7 setup files, it starts loading and hangs. Same thing happened with Hiren in DOS mode. Will be checking if this is a problem because of the 1TB HDD (being too large, 50GB) or could be that the MIUSB which i made is not properly made( maybe defragmented or maybe corrupted). Don\u0027t think it has to do anything with i trying to boot from PLoP. What do you feel about this? ![:unsure:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/unsure.png) Though i was able to load an iso like linux mint without it hanging.   \n\nWith PLoP (a wonderful boot manager) running from the Windows boot menu, it\u0027s like a kind of **portable boot manager** which is not really installed and you can call upon it whenever you want, otherwise you can go the normal way for booting your OS.  \nAnother observation which i made was that when i started the PC the first thing that came is Acronis True Image option (F11) to start the recovery console which allows me to restore backup. Only after i did not choose that option i got Windows boot menu from which i had the choice of either booting directly the internal HDD OS or starting PLoP. This was the doubt which i was having today, which you cleared for me in the post 16, by providing the Option to start PLoP from Windows boot menu and hence the Acronis recovery console remains intact and is not erased etc.  \n\nYour ***valuable and precise*** advice has made it very easy for me to go about the booting of the 1TB WDD :smile:   \n\nNow i have to just figure out if the hanging of the ***Win7 Setup and Hiren*** (these two i tried) is a one of case because the MIUSB installation is defragmented/corrupted, could be another reason.   \nI had a MIUSB installed on a 8GB pendrive (flashdrive). I had made a acronis image backup of this Mission Impossible USB pendrive (a 8GB backup file). So i restored the acronis image backup of the pendrive onto the 1 TB WD HDD (thinking i would get it working faster, instead of going through the whole process of making an installation iof MIUSB on the 1 TB from scratch). I thought i would restore the flashdrive MIUSB image backup to my 1TB HDD. Maybe you cannot use an acronis image backup of MIUSB to restore, but have to do a brand new MIUSB installation (on the 1TB HDD) from scratch. Maybe because of this Win7setup, Hiren is hanging, and the Linux Mint ISO is not hanging. Just wanted your valuable advice on this. ![:dubbio:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/dubbio.gif)   \n"

      "content": "@fms:  \n\nI already knew the solution posted by Chaos and Wonko and applied it several times in my job, but I can tell for sure (relatively to the cases I experimented in my job) that forcing into boot the MyPassport and MyBook series from WD caused the (terrible) issue:  \n\n\"A disk read error occurred. Press CTRL+ALT+DEL to restart\"   \n\n(google is FULL of this \"driving into crazyness\" error).  \n\nthis happened to me in a 50% of the cases, and in my experience the only solution at this point is to reset and flash the bios (I discovered that after hours spent into replacing all cables, internal HD, fixmbr, fixboot, LLF, check disk, renistalling SO, and so on)...   \nif one is lucky, after flashing bios things go right, but in some case (ASUS + P45) **I HAD TO REPLACE THE MOBO** . (not for the bios flashing but because the error was always there unchanged) ![:unsure:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/unsure.png) ![:dubbio:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/dubbio.gif)   \nso...pay a big attention to force that HD into booting :smile:   \n"

      "content": "Hello Wonko The Sane  \nAfter making Mission Impossible USB, and booting 1 TB WD after starting PLoP i get errors while trying to start Hiren, UBCD.  \nUBCD error is \"LBA Cache Flush :Write Error\"  \nHiren error is that the \"Creating 100mb RAM drive as R: \" appears and the screen gets stuck at that.   \nI tried using a pendrive with hiren and ubcd before PLoP and after PLoP. Before starting PLop hiren and UBCD work well. After starint PLoP i get the above errors.  \nIs there any way i could resolve this.   \n\nAlso if i divide the 1 TB into say 16GB (with MIUSB on it) and make the rest into 2 partitions (or even one partition), than the Win 7 setup files fail to load. Meaning they only load if there is a single partition . If there are 2 partitions the begining only when Win 7 setup files are supposed to load they fail at that stage. If i have 2 partitions ![:dubbio:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/dubbio.gif)   \n"

      "content": "Well you won\u0027t get any help for your WAREZ release.  \n\nThe Windows setup failing when more than one partitionis present is strange, I wonder how it was setup, most probably incorrectly, it simply makes no sense.  \n\nPLoP is not \"the\" solution to \"all\" problems, it\u0027s just a way to workaround the problem, it is very likely that some changes must be made to your setup in order to use it, anyway PLoP is NOT limited at the LBA28 addressing space, but other bootloaders involvesd in booting the various things you have on that HD may well be.  \n\nIn any case PLoP adds another layer to the whatever is used in normal operation so that conflicts may well arise.  \n\n![:dubbio:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/dubbio.gif)  \nWonko   \n"

      "content": "Hi Wonko The Sane  \nThanks once again for the tip (hint) which alerted me that the problematic issue could be elsewhere.  \nI have now managed to get Win 7 to load from a 60 GB (fat32) partition, alongwith 2 more partition( the rest ones) which are in ntfs. Now the problem was this:  \nA couple of months back i had altered my Win 7 DVD. The DVD came with only option to install Win 7 Ultimate. I had altered the DVD to be able to use it as a WIN 7 Ultimate or Home Premium, Home basic, Professional \\\u0026 Starter Edition basically a WIn 7 AIO. As the original Win 7 dvds usually come with only one option for the end user. So this was the reason why the dvd was failing to load setup files. When i tried a different Win 7, it worked fine. I was able to make a 60 GB(fat32) and other partitions as ntfs and Win 7 setup files loaded without any problem and the MIUSB works fine on the 1TB WD USB HDD.  \nThe problem with Hiren and UBCD is a different one as in PLoP the \" USB disk access is limited to read only access\" and that\u0027s why the errors.  \nWish i knew how to change the read access to write access also. So that Hiren and UBCD would work. ![:dubbio:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/dubbio.gif)   \n"
