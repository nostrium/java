      "content": "**Windows 7 SBB Tool 1.3**  \n\n**Discription:**   \n\nThe Windows 7 SBB Tool allows you to select any removable device and make a Windows 7 booter. Although commonly used for USB, it can be used for SD cards as well, as long as your BIOS support it! Quickly make a bootable Windows 7 USB device using this small utility.  \n\n**Comments:**   \n\nWe already have BIOS supporting boot from removable storage device like USB drive and SD card however in order to take full advantage of this feature you must first create bootable USB drive of operating of your choice. Now here is a comparatively easy \\\u0026 automated way to create a bootable Windows 7 USB.  \n\nWindows 7 SBB (Serial Bus Booting) is freeware tool which allows you to select any removable device and make a Windows 7 booter. Although commonly used for USB, it can be used for SD cards as well, as long as your BIOS support it! Quickly make a bootable Windows 7 USB device using this small utility.  \n\nThe only disadvantage of Windows 7 SBB Tool is it doesn\u0027t support ISO files. You will have to extract the files to their own independent folder.  \n\n![Posted Image](http://www.blogsdna.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Windows-7-SBB-Tool.jpg)  \n\nOperating System: Windows XP 32bit \\\u0026 64bit / Vista 32bit \\\u0026 64bit / Windows7 32bit \\\u0026 64bit  \n\nSize: 245 KB  \n\nNote: .Net Framework 4.0 is required for this to be able to work  \n\nLicense: Freeware  \n\nPublisher: Rango Software  \n\nLink: [Rango Software blog](http://rangosoftwareblog.co.cc/ \"External link\")  \n\nLink: [Download page for this tool](http://www.softpedia.com/get/System/Boot-Manager-Disk/Windows-7-SBB-Tool.shtml \"External link\")  \n**\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d**   \n\nHi, I stumbled upon this tool and I was wondering if any here at Boot Land know about it and if someone has any experience with it. Does it work ?  \nI ask mainly because there is NO help or guide for this tool. All there is is the publishers blog, and there is no more info on this tool I can find then above.  \nWould like to know how to use it.  \n\nI used search to see if anyone allready made a thread about it and found none.  \nSo, here it is.  \n\nSincerely,  \n\nWilliam   \n"

And if you look just at how these different systems present themselfs, you should realize that, take the MenuetOS site as example, allmost no end user will be confident to install a system based on that limited amount of info as presented. I for one can\u0027t find a clear statement for an end user to understand which kind of operating system it actually is!  \n\u003e MenuetOS is an Operating System in development for the PC written entirely in 32/64 bit assembly language\n![:D](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/biggrin.png) ???   \n\u003e Menuet\u0027s application structure isn\u0027t specifically reserved for asm programming since the header can be produced with practically any other language.\n![:D](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/biggrin.png)   \n\u003e Features  \n\u003e - Pre-emptive multitasking with 1000hz scheduler\n![:unsure:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/unsure.png)   \nWith language like that you will only attract incroud. And they most likely already know to find their way to them if they like it.  \nOr maybe they think putting some nice screenshots on their site is enough to convince anyone these days.  \nAnd this goes for ReactOS as well. The site looks like crap. Unorganized. Not professional at all.  \nThis all goes too for many or even the vast majority of Linux family websites. There is so much choice but no good way to find the OS best suiting your specific needs and desires. A friend of mine asked me if I knew which Linux distro was the best for Gamers. I found no real serious candidates beyond Ultimate Edition Gaming edition. Not that there were no others but none of them made a truly reliable impression on me to be honest. I found one that managed to put a double layer dvd size OS of games out there, but it nowhere mentioned which of the games on it were open source, freeware of demos/trials. I had to figure it all out by investigating the titles mentioned. And a double layer dvd filling amount of games is quite a list to explore. Now a day people don\u0027t have time for that. They have to work work work, it\u0027s still an economic crisis out there for many. And I believe that especially those who are struggling with finances right now are ripe for the picking for an open source (free of cost) operating system. I notice how easy I can convince people these days to start multi-booting with Ubuntu or some other Linux derivative. But having to find a suitable one is a pain, Distro-Watch and similar sites are just not made to convince people. Or in my opinion do a bad job at it.  \nI have found my way to the Linux family not because one day I decided I had enough of my Windddd, but because my system crashed and I needed a sulution, which Microsoft doesn\u0027t provide, or at least not one I could afford. My rescue came wrapped within a Linux, and made me think: \"If this is just an elementary Linux for a rescue CD, there may be more out there I like\".  \nAnd perusing that thought was wise decision I now know.   \n\n(Did I just go on a rampage or what?) :tongue: ![:D](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/biggrin.png)   \n"
