      "content": "It\u0027s a recurring topic.  \n\nThe \"bootable\" SD card slot is something that not many hardwares sport, so the number of people attempting to boot from it is very, very small.  \n\nThe usual plot is ![:unsure:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/unsure.png):  \nOP.:Hey, can we boot from SD?  \nHM.:Maybe, let\u0027s try.  \nOP.: I tried this but it doesn\u0027t work, what else can I try?  \nHM.: Try this other thing...  \nOP: ....vanished in the mist of the net ....![:dubbio:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/dubbio.gif)  \n(where OP is Original Poster and HM is Helping Member)  \n\nIn other words, there are not AFAIK known working methods, and the theories possibly usable have not been tested enough and successfully.  \n\nIf you are game, start from here:  \n[http://www.boot-land...?showtopic\u003d9036](http://www.boot-land.net/forums/index.php?showtopic\u003d9036 \"External link\")  \n\nread the thread and given links in it, then post some info on your actual hardware, and let\u0027s start working...![:D](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/biggrin.png)  \n\n![:D](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/biggrin.png)  \nWonko   \n"

      "content": "OK I am game but for me this is only for entertainment since I dont have a imediate need for doing this so any progress will be slow if at all.  \n\nI do have this SD slot and I also have an SD card with XP via USBoot that boots up through a USB card reader so I think it is possible.  \n\nI read the thread you linked to (all 11 pages) and I think what might work in my senario is to make a kicker CD from the exsisting XP so I need to look into this further.  \n\nI am familiar and have success with Plop for booting USB on older machines that do not support this and I have allready crossposted this topic on the Plop forum.   \n\nI will try not to \"vanish\" about this so if /when I succeed or give up I will post about this also.   \n\nnow to learn more about making this \"kicker\"..  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nthanks   \n"
