      "content": "Hi  \n\nI haven\u0027t been on Bootland for a while as i didn\u0027t really see the avantages 32 bit winpe boot did for me compared to just using a dos network boot disk  \n\nMy job require me to provide a service that allow users to load ghost images of many different PC models over the network. To do this i have implemented TFTP32, Pxelinux and Bart network boot disk to connect to a file server which run a menu (cmd file) that allow the user anywhere to select the ghost image he wants.  \n\nA couple of year ago i looked into winpe to replace dos (Bart network boot disk) however the 100mb wim file downloading over the network made advantage of using ghost 32 seem pointless as the quick load time via ghost was overshadowed with length time actually connect to the server through winpe.  \n\nHowever a couple of year has past and i wondering if anyone can tell me if is worth considering again to replace dos element of my process.   \n"

      "content": "Assuming using win7 WinPE v3  \n\nAdvantages:  \n\n1. Easy to plug in win7 net driver (just call \u0027drvload myinf.inf\u0027)  \n2. Availability of win7 drivers better than DOS driver  \n3. Faster hard disk access - DOS uses BIOS which is often slow, winPE uses DMA driver so is much faster. Ghost32 will be much faster at disk access than Ghost on some systems which do not have DMA support in BIOS int13h.  \n4. Easy access to NTFS filesystem if required  \n5. Supports .hta files so can make a \u0027web\u0027 menu GUI.  \n\nDisadvantages:  \n1. Win 7/Vista drivers may not be available for older systems  \n2. Need 512MB RAM  \n3. Need to load 150MB via PXE initially  \n4. WinPE v3 takes a while to load and initialise (but faster than WinPE v2).  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nI use a \\\\DRIVERS folder on a USB pen. When WinPE boots, it DRVLOADS all NIC drivers under the \\\\DRIVERS folder. So if I have new xxx h/w, I just drop the new Win7 driver into the \\\\DRIVERS\\\\xxx folder on my USB pen and job done!   \n"

      "content": "First thanks for the detailed replies (much appreciated)  \n\nIf true that 20รท35 Mb size range .wim can now be created that is well perfect and the ability to use a usb pen as an external repository for network driver also sounds interesting. Looks like things have moved on since i last look at this.  \n\nRegarding the two years question i am sure it was around two i last looked into a winpe (winpe.wim)   \n\nanyway  \n\nIs there a tutorial on how to create a minimal version of a PE? (apologies if this is in the links supplied as i have not gone through them yet - that\u0027s what I be doing for the rest of the afternoon along with trying to understand win builder again ![:mellow:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/mellow.png) )   \n"

(I don\u0027t think that in order to run a command line app or even a semi-graphical GUI one you really need a high resolution or high number of colours for your monitor, nor audio).  \n\nFor a first test of a little PE 1.x, use this old thingy:  \n[http://www.911cd.net...showtopic\u003d16543](http://www.911cd.net/forums//index.php?showtopic\u003d16543 \"External link\")  \n[http://hooovahh.goog...m/BartAIO1.4.7z](http://hooovahh.googlepages.com/BartAIO1.4.7z \"External link\")  \n\nCheck also the OLD (good) native_ex projects:  \n[http://www.boot-land...?showtopic\u003d4696](http://www.boot-land.net/forums/?showtopic\u003d4696 \"External link\")  \nPicoXP would be a good starting point (if using Winbuilder).  \n\n![:mellow:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/mellow.png)  \nWonko   \n"
