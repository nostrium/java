      "content": "I wanted to try out Plop Bootmanager and tryed to boot NaughtyPE of a USB-Stick, on a machine which does not support booting from USB.  \n\nGood news, booting from USB works fine. Bad news, it takes incredible long.  \n\nIf i boot this stick on my new machine, which supports usb booting out of BIOS, it takes 29 seconds, till the bootup is finished.  \n\nOn the test machine, i use a USB2 PCI card and the bootup requires 3 minutes. Booting of CD takes just 1,40min!  \nWhen i test the read speed of the stick, from within the booted NaughtyPE, then i get 25MB/s, which is the same as on my new machine. ![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif)  \n\nI also tested booting over one of the onboard USB1.1 ports to see if the USB 2 ports may only run as 1.1 during boot.  \nBut booting up over USB1.1 takes almost 20 minutes.  \n\nSo i\u0027m pretty confused and have no idea what goes wrong. Any ideas?  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif)   \n"

      "content": "speed test of usb in windows is NOTHING to do while booting from it.because as you may know , usb speed is vary at boot time and while in windows.   \n\nit is for sure that this PLOP driver works , on my asus A7v400 (pretty old ) , it DOES emulate the usb 2.0 speed on USB 1.1 .   \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nin case the things remain like this , report Elmar (author of PLOP) on his forums or on IRC about this bug .,and he ll fix it in next release or even give you the alpha release to test .  \n\nhe does it mostly . and many motherboards were strange which he had to fix in his driver .   \n"

      "content": "Did some computing, and now i\u0027m more confused than before.  \n\nThe pure loading of the 181MB ramdisk image takes 140 seconds, which means a transfer speed of 1,29 MB/s, with USB2.0 card and Plop, that sounds bad even for USB 1.1, imo.  \n\nHowever the USB 1.1 ports have a loading time for the image of roughly 18 minutes, with Plop. That means 0,167 MB/s! ![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif)  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif)   \n"

Plop does not deliver the performance of the BIOS solutions at the moment, but promised that the next version will feature some optimizations to make it faster.  \n\n![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif)   \n"
