GRUB error 22 happened in there somewhere too. i then wrote a new parition table to see if it was bad partitioning or if i was the MBR.   \n\nbooting the netbook now from the hard disk throws up GRUB error 17. anything trying to onstall to hard disk throws the 0000007b error.   \n\nas it is a netbook, i have no CD and i don\u0027t want to take the disk out since it is only a few days old.   \n\nthanks for any advice   \n"

Normal installation to SATA/RAID disk need floppy disk.   \nUser have to press F6 during setup boot loading and load SCSI/RAID/SATA driver from floppy disk.   \nBut many computers don\u0027t have floppy disk drive.  \n2. Another possibility is to modify setup files, integrate SATA driver in it.  \nSome people made automated tools to do this.   \n- I think nLite is the easiest way to integrate SATA driver in Window XP setup CD. But It may have a little problem for installation from USB without CD. I am not sure.  \n- USBMultiBoot is another solution. I have not tried it yet. No comment.  \n3. Virtual floppy disk for F6.  \nLike in this thread [http://www.msfn.org/...ge-t137714.html](http://www.msfn.org/board/install-xp-ram-loaded-iso-image-t137714.html \"External link\")  \nI have not tried it yet.   \n\nThe latest Intel SATA/RAID 32-bit F6 floppy is here.  \n[http://downloadcente...p;DwnldID\u003d17883](http://downloadcenter.intel.com/Detail_Desc.aspx?ProdId\u003d2101\u0026DwnldID\u003d17883 \"External link\")   \n"
