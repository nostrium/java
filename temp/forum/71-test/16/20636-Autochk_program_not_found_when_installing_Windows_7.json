      "content": "I got this error 3 times last night when trying to finish 7 install. My ISO is Microsoft-issued, verified with MSDN hashes. It works fine in VMware Workstation and VirtualBox. I did check and the autochk exe is found in C:\\\\Windows (can\u0027t remember which subfolder, if any).\n\nI tried installing from burned disc, USB, as well as from a NTFS partition with setup files stored there (using a FAT32 USB to bootstrap into UEFI mode). I also tried mounting the ISO in my Zalman VE 400. UEFI DUET was used, which I suspect isn\u0027t the issue.\n\nI also tried creating all my partitions on both of my drives in advance, with the first SSD target disk containing only a FAT32 EFI volume and a 2nd NTFS volume for 7.\n\nI tried both installing from imagex and bcdboot, as well as from the official GUI setup, after deleting all partitions and the partition tables from both disks. When using the GUI, setup reaches the end just before reboot, and says that the install couldn\u0027t be completed.\n\nStrangely enough, I got this exact same error when restoring from official Alienware recovery discs, which will only restore in BIOS/MBR mode.\n\nThis thread is basically a continuation of my previous \"Windows installation repeatedly fails to complete\", but because I now have a very specific error and can\u0027t determine the cause, I started this topic. I no longer suspect my RAM to be the issue, or my drives, both of whose SMART data checks out fine, and both drives being relatively new (bought in the past 120 days).\n\nI also noticed that no pagefile.sys or hiberfil.sys is ever created during install, by either the GUI or when using ImageX.\n\n"

      "content": "I\u0027ll compare it in the next few hours,although I\u0027m certain the error count has gone up. I\u0027ve been trying to switch back and forth repeatedly between data and data modes by flashing different bioses, as described in my previous thread, but data has been somewhat unstable because, from my understanding, there was an issue in the early SATA controllers with my model. Later revisions of my model had the issue fixed, with something called \"B3 stepping\", which mine has. But despite that many owners of my model still report instability when using sata3. The general idea is to get the max speed from my SSD.\n\nFor the past few weeks I\u0027ve been using a bios that limits SATA speeds to 2, as Dell had intended as a partial counterfix to the problem. But this autochk thing still comes up.\n\nAre new sata cables manufactured for laptops? As well as sata controllers? Are they easy to replace?\n\n"

      "content": "@ Wonko: The highest-priced cable you listed is around $55. A bit steep, but if it fixes my issues, then it means I\u0027ve finally found the source, and well worth the cost of not having more headaches and continually reinstalling Windows again and again.\n\nBut before I order anything, is there a way to prove my current SATA cable is defective? Like, with actual tests, not just conjecture and hypotheses. I\u0027d rather not order anything if the cable I have is perfectly fine. I found your listings earlier when I was searching around (before you posted).\n\nIf the issue is the SATA controller rather than the cable, then a new cable wont help. I suppose a technician would charge a steep price to replace the controller. Or simply refuse to do it.\n\nI\u0027m very nearly ready to murder the Asian guy that sold me this laptop, because he probably knew it had issues. If I sell something I always disclose all known issues.\n\nEdit: New problem. I deleted all partitions from the SSD, and zeroed out the partition table. Then I booted into a physical, freshly burned disc, used \u0027clean\u0027 command in disk part, and created a primary NTFS volume, formatted it, and marked as active. Intended partition table is BIOS/MBR, not using native UEFI or DUET. The first portion of setup completes, then it reboots to finish up. But it never gets to that point, error \"bootmgr is missing\" appears. It definitely sounds like something is causing data to be corrupted as it is written. A new SATA cable is the only thing I haven\u0027t tried.\n\n"

      "content": "hi AnonVendetta, Wonko,  \n\nin the past when booting a universal XP clone on different USB sticks I have ran into the same error.  \n\nIIRC the problem was either from cross-linked (inadvertently) XP versions on different partitions (in my case solved by using encryption to make the different XP\u0027s not see each other) OR incorrect partitioning due to incorrectly setting up extended partitions for booting.  \n\nIMO it is essentially a type of disc read error. it cant find autochk for what ever reason.  \n\nedit: in your case I would investigate the format further. check partition types with mbrwiz and other tools to compare them and see if they agree. (ive had conflicting results in the past where windows said a partition was NTFS but mbrwhiz reported fat16) and maybe try different tools to format with.   \n"
