      "content": "I\u0027ve been having an issue as of very recently, which is that no matter which version of Windows I try to install, the setup simply wont finish after the initial reboot. It always BSODs, with either \"bugcode_usbdriver\" or \"an attempt was made to execute to non-executable memory\". Or it will hang on the 7/8.1 boot logo and never go further. Thusfar I have tried Server 2008 R2 x64, 7 Enterprise x64, and 8.1 Enterprise x64. All are uncracked, original volume licensing Microsoft ISOs, obtained from various sources, md5 and sha1 hashes checked against what Microsoft provides. If/when the bugcode_USB BSOD occurs, no USB device is plugged in. Strangely enough, various Linuxes install fine.\n\nI opted to install in UEFI mode, with imagex, and bcdboot to install boot files. I cant use the regular Windows GUI setup, because I have 1 EFI on each of my laptop\u0027s internal drive, which confuses the setup, with error \"We couldnt create a new partition or locate an existing one\". Both drives are pre-partitioned with GParted:\n\nimagex /apply Z:\\\\sources\\\\install.wim 1 C:\n\nand\n\nbcdboot C:\\\\Windows /l en-US /s A: /f ALL\n\nC is Windows destination partition, A: is EFI. The /f ALL variable was only used with 8.1, it isnt a valid parameter for 7 and 2008 R2. I used GetWAIKTools to obtain the needed files, using the appropriate version of imagex and bcdboot as per the desired OS. Install files and tools were placed on a FAT32 partition (1st partition) on an external USB HDD. I booted the installer with UEFI DUET, since my UEFI BIOS seems to be unable to boot from any partition on a USB in UEFI mode. It only seems to boot in native UEFI (no DUET) if the boot files are on the 1st partition (unsure about this) of my laptop\u0027s primary drive in the master slot. I recently installed an optical drive caddy, containing a Seagate 2TB drive. UEFI booting from anywhere on that drive seems impossible (directly, without chainloading), it simply isnt an available boot option in my BIOS.\n\nAfter installing via DUET completes, I power off and natively UEFI boot without DUET, Windows logo appears to complete install, and BAM, shortly thereafter, the BSOD or hang almost always occurs (finally managed to install 8.1today without crashing, but it took several tries, following my above steps, which I know to be correct). I believe this is a deeper symptom of a hardware issue, but need help determining which component(s) is fail(ing). Possibles:\n\n1. Modded BIOS ( I cant boot in native UEFI mode with any other flashed BIOS, except via DUET, everything has been reset to defaults in BIOS, except that UEFI and \"UEFI boot first\" has been selected)\n\n2. Bad RAM (need to run extended tests with MemTest86+, planning to replace my current 6GB with 16GB soon)\n\n3. Bad drive in primary master slot (tests indicate that is has several hundred bad sectors thusfar, but it still boots and \\*seems\\* fine for now.\n\n4. Bad HDD in optical caddy (unlikely since the drive was just bought and installed last week), I\u0027m not booting from it anyway.\n\n5. Both drives may be causing a power surge that is too much for my laptop\u0027s power supply/brick to handle (150 watts rated), therefore not supplying enough power. See my question on superuser.com regarding a similar issue with a previous laptop, current PC doesnt seem to have said issue:\n\n[http://superuser.com...-in-windows-8-1](http://superuser.com/questions/862980/secondary-internal-hdd-vanishes-reappears-randomly-in-windows-8-1 \"External link\")\n\n6. Bad USB ports (unlikely, all seem to work fine with my devices, in both 2.0 and 3.0 modes)\n\n7. Bad battery (testing indicates my battery is failing, it doesnt hold much of a charge even when not gaming, and drains somewhat fast).\n\n8. Installing in UEFI/GPT mode instead of BIOS/MBR mode.\n\nThis isnt technically related to booting, and I know reboot.pro isnt a general tech support forum, but I\u0027d appreciate some help with this nonetheless. None of this wasnt occuring as of several days ago.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n**Edited by AnonVendetta, 20 April 2015 - 05:08 PM.**\n"

      "content": "I will try flashing the latest A08 (official, unmodded) BIOS and install in BIOS/MBR mode (since the official BIOS has the UEFI option hidden), I doubt it will make a difference. And I will try again later, once again, with the modded BIOS I\u0027m currently using.\n\nThe RAM I have may or may not be bad, I have good mind to run tests with MemTest86+ overnight tonight for several hours, to see what the results are. I can also try removing one stick or the other and booting with just one. One stick is 4GB, the other is 2GB. All recent Windows OSes can still boot with 2GB RAM, albeit slower. The question, of course, is determining which one is bad, if either. But I consider it a moot point,since I\u0027ll be replacing them next month anyway.\n\nAs for nthe HDDs, the 2TB Seagate in the caddy slot is certainly good, and practically new, I can try removing the caddy, and swapping the 2TB into the primary master slot, booting with only one drive, which would also (hopefully) eliminate any chance of power overdraw on the power supply. But that will mean I will have to install on GPT partitioning, given the size. Or with DUET. I suspect DUET isn\u0027t the issue anyways, it was and still continues to work fine.\n\nUSB ports obviously can\u0027t be removed, but I\u0027ll see if they can be disabled in BIOS, or at least set to legacy compatibility mode. I\u0027ll need them to install an OS anyway, but can try to disable them before allowing Windows to complete setup after the initial reboot that the GUI installer does.\n\nReplacing the battery isn\u0027t possible yet, but I can try to install without the battery, with only the AC adapter plugged in. To be precise, the power supply/brick itself is fine, it\u0027s the battery that\u0027s bad. And I haven\u0027t found any PSUs for my model (Dell, 3rd party, or otherwise) that are rated for higher than 150 watts (what I currently have). Both battery and PSU are stock.\n\n"

      "content": "It\u0027s been almost 2 months since my first post, and I\u0027m a bit closer to digging down to the source(s) of my issue stated in thread title. I can now at least install Windows, both 8.1 and 7, and they do boot, but......\n\nI recently replaced the failing primary drive with an SSD, which I\u0027ve had zero issues with, and placed the Seagate 2TB in the optical caddy slot. Since both drives are practically new, I think it\u0027s safe to rule them out as the source. I\u0027ve checked the health of both drives, as well as checking for drive errors, all tests came up clean.\n\nWindows 8.1 has been behaving erratically in recent weeks, for instance, brief but constant hangs, higher than normal RAM usage even while idle, a few random BSODs here and there.\n\nI tried going back to 7 last night, just to see if I would get different results, and for a few hrs at least, everything seemed fine, no lag, everything running smooth, etc. But then I tried to install Windows Updates, and somewhere along the line the system suddenly BSODed while I was trying to load a browser page. This is the worst time a crash can occur, and almost impossible to fix short of rolling back to a known good backup, but I hadn\u0027t had time to do that yet. 2 subsequent 7 reinstalls resulted in the system hanging at the Windows logo on initial boot after install completion. Several forced shutdowns/powerons finally got setup to finish, and upon arriving at the desktop I immediately ran an SFC /scannow, to my surprise no corrupt files were found and the system didn\u0027t destabilize. I\u0027m now attempting to install updates again to see what results I will get.\n\nIn the meantime, this narrows the most likely culprits down to bad RAM or a failing battery. I have briefly tested both RAM sticks simultaneously for as long as I could (less than 1.5 hrs, not even 2 runs) but testing found no errors during that time. Since I\u0027m replacing the RAM with 16GB anyway, it doesn\u0027t really matter, but I haven\u0027t been able to conclusively fault or rule the memory out one way or another.\n\nOne question though, Dell\u0027s diagnostic built into the BIOS definitely indicates a failing battery, but isn\u0027t this unlikely to be the cause? I ask this because notebooks can generally run without a battery if they\u0027re plugged into AC power, which mine nearly always is. Also, how can I know whether the power supply (brick/charging cord) may also be bad? By coincidence a friend recently bought a model that is 100% identical to mine, except he has an HDD rather than an SSD, and no optical caddy. My PSU charges/powers his notebook just fine (couldn\u0027t persuade him to temp-swap other parts LOL).\n\nOn another sidenote, I can\u0027t, by necessity replace my modded BIOS with any of the official BIOSes, since the one I have restores my laptop\u0027s ability to run at SATA 3 speeds rather than being artificially throttled (by Dell) to SATA 2. This would slow my SSD down and this is unacceptable. I\u0027ve ran benchmarks to check the speed difference and it is definitely noticeable. I will rule out UEFI for now, only considering it as a last resort. I\u0027m convinced this is a matter of hardware issues, not firmware mode.\n\nIf all else fails I may need to seek the advice of an experienced technician for a comprehensive diagnosis.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n**Edited by AnonVendetta, 08 June 2015 - 02:49 AM.**\n"

CPU usage was less than 20% while installing updates, RAM usage around half. In any case, I doubt my CPU is bad or else the laptop would probably be unusable.\n\nBut what I\u0027m really curious to know is, what might be causing 7 to freeze at the startup logo. 8.1 has never done this, except on an older HP laptop, which was due to a system file that constantly stayed corrupt despite repairing it. It has only happened once after my most recent 7 installs, all other reboots have went fine.\n\n**Edited by AnonVendetta, 08 June 2015 - 03:49 AM.**\n"

      "content": "After some long thinking I\u0027ve decided to simply install a Linux Mint root partition on the SSD, along with a swap and /home partition on the HDD. All Windows data is being moved to an external drive and both internal drives are being dedicated to Linux for up to a month. I figure it\u0027s best to reduce the overall hits on the SSD in the short and long term by not burdening it with Windows installs that will simply continue to crash, etc for whatever reason(s) unknown to me at this time, and will continue to do so until the unknowns are fixed.\n\nI\u0027m going to run under this setup until I can replace both the RAM and the battery, then try again later to see if my issues are solved. If not, then something else is obviously interfering.\n\nAs far as the KERNEL_DATA_INPAGE_ERROR, I\u0027ve read it\u0027s due to disk errors/failure/failing, but SMART tests have revealed that both drives are fine and have neither bad sectors nor pending bad sectors. Chkdsk/Checkdisk revealed no errors either. The latest BSOD along this line appeared to mentioned NTFS.sys, but it flashed by too fast for me to read it all. I really do hope this is just a bad RAM/battery issue rather than bad ram sockets, because that will mean the motherboard needs to be replaced, in which case I\u0027ll either sell the laptop as-is or junk it. I also tried without a page file but got the same BSOD as before, which to me means that the page file itself couldn\u0027t be the issue since it didn\u0027t exist at that time.\n\nI\u0027m just pissed in regards to the contradictory results I\u0027m getting. Testing shows RAM as fine, but some of the issues I\u0027m experiencing clearly implicate the RAM as a factor. And yet other errors indicate the disks/volume(s) could be bad, yet both drives are seemingly fine, and new.\n\nI just find it amazing how Linux can carry along unscathed under the same conditions that continually either crash Windows or cause erratic behavior, bad overall performance, etc. The only explanations are either that Linux is a more resilient and well-designed OS, and moreover, seemingly superior in many ways.\n\n**Edited by AnonVendetta, 08 June 2015 - 06:05 AM.**\n"

I\u0027m also going to run some tests on it tomorrow for a few hrs per stick, one at a time, to make sure there are no errors. They certainly weren\u0027t DOA, but that doesnt mean they wont produce errors.\n\nI have yet to reinstall Windows yet, I\u0027m too tired tonight to bother. I\u0027ll do it tomorrow and see what results I get.\n\nI\u0027m beginning to consider your input that my modded BIOS may be causing my drives to run at a faster SATA 3 speed rather than SATA 2. It\u0027s certainly possible that Dell de-specced them because SATA 3 may be unstable for my model in some cases. I have read reports to the effect on other forums by people saying that SATA 3 on the M14X R1 was unstable and crashed alot, whereas others reported no issues. My friend with the identical model is using the same BIOS mod as me and has stated that he has had no issues whatsoever thusfar, no crashes, nothing. But he only has the stock HDD, stock RAM, no SSD, and no secondary HDD in an optical caddy either. His battery also isnt failing. He has the stock Windows 7 Home Premium x64 by Dell, it came installed that way from the guy he bought it from, and he\u0027s not messing with it by reinstalling Windows or other OSes. Essentially identical other than that.\n\nAs for the BIOS mod, there are several versions of it, including a few that dont restore SATA 3 (still runs at SATA 2). These other BIOSes still allow for the unlocked options, like the CPU/VRAM/RAM OCing stuff that Dell tucked. As well as the option to boot in UEFI or legacy modes. I will try downloading several variants that dont have the SATA fix, to see what results I get.\n\nBut for now, you mentioned something about UDMA. I took some screenshots from a Parted Magic live USB, maybe someone can take a look at them. I cant really decipher them, whether the info they contain is good nor bad.\n\nThe first 2 shots are for the SSD, the last 2 are for the HDD in the caddy, I tried to post 4 images I uploaded at imgur.com but this site wont let me: Links below:\n\n[http://imgur.com/u2j684l](http://imgur.com/u2j684l \"External link\")\n\n[http://imgur.com/mwlAA6T](http://imgur.com/mwlAA6T \"External link\")\n\n[http://i.imgur.com/VytH0Vr.png](http://i.imgur.com/VytH0Vr.png \"External link\")\n\n[http://i.imgur.com/YjjMqQn.png](http://i.imgur.com/YjjMqQn.png \"External link\")\n\nThe 1st and 3rd screenshots report that both drives are running in SATA 3/6GBPS mode/speed.\n\nThanks!\n\n**Edited by AnonVendetta, 17 June 2015 - 08:35 AM.**\n"

      "content": "The SSD UDMA CRC Error Count is showing as 97% health and the Raw count has 2664 (which could mean it had 2664 instances of errors).\n\nIn contrast, the ST2000 shows 100% health and only 67 Raw count errors.\n\nSo it does indicate that the SSD in particular is getting UDMA data transfer CRC errors.\n\nSometimes this can be due to cheap SATA cables (DON\u0027T bundle them together - keep each SATA cable separate and well away from each other!). Many people try to bundle their cables together to keep them tidy but this is very bad! It can cause interference between cables. I have seen this with both SATA and IDE cables. I have also seen poor quality SATA cables cause data problems. This is not \u0027rumour\u0027 or \u0027conjecture\u0027 but it is from 30 years of direct personal experience in a factory which has built millions of PCs/notebooks.\n\nIf you are using good quality, shortish, nicely separated SATA cables, then the errors may indicate a data transfer problem with the mainboard/chipset. The only way to fix that is - do not use SATA3.\n\n"

      "content": "I just tried installing Windows 7 with ImageX and BCDBoot, on fresh partitions with a new partition table. After rebooting to let the install complete, the 7 logo appeared, and then BAM, instantly I got the BSOD with error \"an attempt was made to execute to non-executable memory\". So clearly my issue isn\u0027t solved, something else is interfering. I\u0027m guessing my RAM isn\u0027t the issue this time, since I\u0027ve replaced it.\n\nThe BIOS files I need are at the TechInferno.com forums, however downloading from there requires registration, and your first 5 posts must be approved by a moderator, at which point you can download files. I am a member but only have 2 posts, 3 more would require around another day before they\u0027re approved. I would rather post something that has useful info, instead of just posting to increase post count for download rights.\n\nThe files I need are at [http://forum.techinf....html#post12003](http://forum.techinferno.com/alienware-m14x-aw-14/561-%5Bmod%5D-voltage-increase-nvidia-gt-555m-7.html#post12003 \"External link\"). I specifically need \"[M14x \\[unlocked\\] A08 with voltmod.zip](http://forum.techinferno.com/attachments/alienware-m14x-aw-14/3214d1325867857-m14x-%5Bunlocked%5D-a08-voltmod.zip \"External link\")\", \"[M14x A08 - voltmod.zip](http://forum.techinferno.com/attachments/alienware-m14x-aw-14/3234d1325960180-m14x-a08-voltmod.zip \"External link\")\", and \"[M14x A08 - voltmod - GF116 fix.zip](http://forum.techinferno.com/attachments/alienware-m14x-aw-14/3936d1333795281-m14x-a08-voltmod-gf116-fix.zip \"External link\")\". They dont have the SATA fix. If someone can download them and send them to me via alternate means, I\u0027d be very grateful. Waiting another day wont kill me, but I\u0027d like to be able to do some testing sooner rather than later. I was able to BIOS I already have installed for over a month now, by Googling the zip file\u0027s name, I found a copy of it on another site, no such luck with the 3 listed above.\n\nThanks!\n\n**Edited by AnonVendetta, 18 June 2015 - 08:34 AM.**\n"

      "content": "steve6375\u0027s suggestions about my modded BIOS and its\u0027 supposed SATA fix appears to be spot-on. It now seems that running in SATA 3 was the primary source of my system instabilities. At this point I\u0027ve managed to rule out every other hardware component as the source of my problems.\n\nI flashed another version of my BIOS that simply had the hidden menus unlocked, but with no other mods/fixes. Windows 7 booted on the 1st try after that, the update process completed successfully (no BSOD at #151), no crashes. The only issue I\u0027ve ran into is that 7 will periodically hang on the Windows logo while rebooting, but no crashes or bad system files as a result, just a hard poweroff/reboot to solve it. It mostly seems to appear while coldbooting, but rarely if ever during reboots. This may be indicative of yet another issue I\u0027m not yet aware of.\n\nI\u0027m working with some guys that say they\u0027ve gotten SATA 3 working on my model, and stable. I\u0027d like to know their methods so I can experiment. But for now, SATA 2 seems more stable for the most part. I have proof (screenshots) which I\u0027ll post later. But for I dont have any time left to continue typing, so I\u0027ll post back later with more details and questions.\n\n"
