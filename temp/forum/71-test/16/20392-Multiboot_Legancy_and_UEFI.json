      "content": "Hi there!\n\nI hope I find help here. I would like to create a multiboot that will work in two modes. After loading the bios boot manager will have to choose Legancy and UEFI. After selecting Legancy reads a menu with a choice such as: Avira / Hirren boot / Memtest etc. After selecting the UEFI mode reads the same way but with a choice of menu installers Windows 7 / 8.1 / 10 x64. Best to read directly ISO. What I\u0027ve tried?\n\n- UEFI_MULTI  \n- Yumi  \n- Multisystem (Linux)  \n- Clover  \n- refind  \n- Easy2boot  \n- Similar to the above.\n\nAll of the above do not work to a certain extent as if I wanted to. I am currently using Syslinux 6.03. Unfortunately, after all of the files (both files .efi) flash drive is visible only for Legancy mode.  \nMaybe some of you have any ideas?  \nRegards!\n\n"

      "content": "If you add WinPE8SE files to a FAT32 E2B drive then you can install any Windows from ISO using WinNTSetup and ImDisk from a UEFI boot.\n\n[http://www.rmprepusb...ual-32-64bit-pe](http://www.rmprepusb.com/tutorials/127-make-dual-32-64bit-pe \"External link\")\n\nYou can also add rEFInd to boot other UEFI files too.\n\nAFAIK it is not possible to UEFI-boot directly from an ISO on a USB drive.\n\n"
