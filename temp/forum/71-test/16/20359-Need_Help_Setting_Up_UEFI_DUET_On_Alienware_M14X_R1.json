      "content": "So, I recently bought an Alienware M14X R1 on Craigslist. It was manufactured in early 2011. And I just now discovered that it has no support for UEFI whatsoever. I had looked through the BIOS before purchasing and noticed that UEFI options weren\u0027t present anywhere, but the laptop was in such good condition and it was a really good deal for the price, that this wasn\u0027t a dealbreaker for me. The seller was honest and didn\u0027t try to up the price at all. And so far it has exceeded my expectations in terms of playing games, even newer titles seem to run pretty well on it. I haven\u0027t had any major issues thusfar. Installing Windows 8.1 Pro was easy enough, the biggest issue I had was finding the right drivers. But now everything is running like a dream.\n\nHowever, I would now like to experience the benefits of booting Windows on GPT partitioning, and I now realize that emulating Windows via DUET will be the only viable option for doing so on my hardware. I recently found milindsmart\u0027s post here on reboot.pro ([http://reboot.pro/to...in-bios-to-gpt/](http://reboot.pro/topic/19516-hack-bootmgr-to-boot-windows-in-bios-to-gpt/ \"\")). But using that method isn\u0027t desirable, since it won\u0027t allow for repairing Windows via the native options available on the setup USB. And I am uncertain of how to get it working in conjunction with an Arch Linux dualboot scenario, which preferably will boot in UEFI mode on GPT partitioning.\n\nI have also noticed a few other things, which are, namely, that DUET supposedly doesn\u0027t support AHCI mode. I have read that using IDE mode will be necessary. Now that 2015 is here, is this still the case?\n\nIf I can get some assistance in getting this set up, and what I will need to do so, then I would be very grateful. I know that I will at least need one USB drive, a Windows setup USB/disc (for dual-boot), and (preferably) some flavor of Linux to initially set up DUET, as well as SysLinux or GRUB2.\n\nI also apologize in advance if I posted this in the wrong area of the forum, I\u0027m relatively new here. Feel free to relocate it to the correct area if neccessary.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n"

If you post count here is any indication of your knowledge, then we both know full well what the benefits of GPT partitioning are, VS the old MBR/BIOS standard. Nor do I need to justify my reasons for pursuing this, I have my reasons for doing what I do, as do you. It\u0027s none of my business what others\u0027 motivations are, and I expect the same in return.\n\nI understand full well what milindsmart wanted to accomplish, he wanted to boot \\*Windows\\* on \\*GPT\\* in \\*BIOS\\* mode. I, on the other hand, want to boot \\*Windows\\* on \\*GPT\\* in \\*UEFI\\* mode, or at least some kind of UEFI emulation layer, which is what UEFI DUET is. Please read those 2 sentences twice. I read a great deal on the topic you linked, months before I ever posted or even registered here. But until now I have had no real need to pursue what it is I\u0027m doing. It eventually occured to me, that, for reasons I don\u0027t understand and don\u0027t care to understand, that you guys were, in essence, trying to defeat booting in UEFI mode, by opting to boot Windows in BIOS mode on GPT instead. And so I decided that, while interesting, it wouldn\u0027t be the right approach in my case. DUET, hackish or not, at least will go further towards my goal of \\*emulating\\* a UEFI environment. And that is exactly what it is primarily intended for, for UEFI developers and people like myself with older hardware that don\u0027t support UEFI. If my hardware did support UEFI, DUET wouldn\u0027t be a consideration, and I wouldn\u0027t be posting here at all.\n\nAnd besides all of that, UEFI is slowly becoming the future for booting computers. BIOS is dying out. UEFI\u0027s bugs are being ironed out. What you guys were trying to do, seemed at best an interesting yet complicated project, yet still fighting against the tide in a losing battle.\n\nAlso, I succinctly stated that my hardware doesn\u0027t support UEFI in any way whatsoever. No options in the BIOS for \"legacy/compatibility\" mode, \"Secure Boot\", etc. Perhaps you you could have taken my word for it and we could have worked from there.\n\nWith all that said, if your only purpose in posting in my thread is to attempt to convince me that the approach in the thread you linked is the best way for me to proceed, then please kindly move along, I\u0027m not interested. But if you\u0027re interested in helping me get DUET set up, then you\u0027re welcome to continue this line of conversation with me. I apologize if I sound rude or standoffish, I can be that way sometimes without being aware of it or meaning to do it, so take it how you want.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n"

      "content": "Despite the offensive level of aggression that was entirely unneeded, I think a few things need to be cleared up (which Wonko might have explained if you hadn\u0027t lost your cool like a rabid shrew).  \n\nUEFI is a \\*firmware\\* interface - it is a superior way of interacting with the hardware as compared to BIOS. The vast majority of the point of UEFI is to establish a baseline functionality in the machine that an operating system or boot-time utility can utilise and build on.  \n\nWhen UEFI is not present, much of the benefits of the firmware interface are lost if you emulate it : it will still ultimately start up through a 512-byte boot sector, which also (can) contain 4 partitions squeezed in, along with a measly 4-byte disk signature.  \n\nThere can still be some benefit to using emulated UEFI as a way to let all OSes start from a uniform platform, but I\u0027m unaware of the existence of any other concrete OR theoretical benefits. Meanwhile this approach causes the OS to depend on the UEFI implementation, which is a GENERIC application meant to be customised further for actual hardware. Using a tianocore reference implementation with a real hardware board with no customisation for your machine sounds like a pointless abstraction.   \n"

      "content": "Perhaps this topic got off on the wrong foot, although I prefer to think of it as a misunderstanding. At this point I was about ready to just forget about this DUET thing and move on. But I don\u0027t give up so easily, and, DUET or not, I wasn\u0027t about to let this topic die without at least clarifying a few things. So..........\n\nWhat you guys see as agressiveness, actually isn\u0027t. I just felt that Wonko was asking an unnecessary question, which was, in a nutshell, that he had asked to me explain the benefits of GPT. I took that as him asking me as a way to try to get an insight into why I\u0027m pursuing this, i.e. questioning my motivations. In tech forums, motivations generally don\u0027t matter, it is the knowledge that matters, and those 2 things are entirely separate from each other. Knowledge is one thing, what one does with that knowledge is his own business. And I clearly have no unethical motivations here (or at least it should be fairly obvious, anyway).\n\n2nd, as of his first post, I felt really had no intention of advising how I could accomplish a DUET setup, but rather that he was really only planning to ask questions and try to convince/explain to me why I shouldn\u0027t bother going about this. I already have my mind made up, help or no help, and I\u0027m of the opinion that an individual really has no business posting in a topic if he has no useful info to contribute right from the get-go, without questioning or trying to convince otherwise, etc. If there is nothing that can be contributed, then it\u0027s best to refrain from posting in the topic at all.\n\nTo give you a better oversight of how I think, it goes something like this:\n\n1. Person A asks question\n\n2. Person B comes along, know\u0027s the answer to A\u0027s question, or possesses other info that can at least help bring about a solution. If on the other hand B has no relevant info or has other intentions, etc, then it\u0027s best for him/her to not post at all.\n\nThings really are that simple to me, I\u0027m a straightforward, no-BS type of guy, and I have no patience for runarounds and beating around the bush with people. I tend to get annoyed by others very easily, and prefer not to deal with them at all if it can be avoided.\n\n@ Wonko: You can look at going beyond the 2.2TB limit as a need rather than a benefit, in this world everything is a matter of perspective. HDDs/storage are getting ever bigger these days, so in reality being able to use disks larger than 2.2TB really is a benefit. You have a very strange definition of \"senseless feature\".\n\n@ Milind: I\u0027m well aware that UEFI is a firmware interface, in much the same way that BIOS is a firmware interface of sorts, albeit much older. I also understand UEFI is probably largely useless in hardware such as mine, which doesn\u0027t natively support it. I\u0027m not concerned about losing benefits, I really have nothing to lose, and knowledge to gain.\n\nSo, I\u0027ll go ahead and give you and Wonko a roundabout explanation of why I\u0027m doing this. As of a few months ago, I had always booted all OSes in BIOS/MBR mode. But then I made the jump to UEFI, after reading up on the benefits of UEFI and GPT and clearing up a few misconceptions I had (such as, Secure Boot and UEFI are one and the same, they obviously arent, but I didnt understand this until recently. I had numerous issues dualbooting with Linux as a result of this, and viewed SB as a PITA to be avoided at all costs). But anyways, long story short, my old PC grew legs and walked away, so now I\u0027m temporarily stuck with older hardware until I can buy something much better.\n\nI also like to learn, and I\u0027m determined to continue using UEFI or some form of it on my current hardware, even if it\u0027s only emulated, for the purpose of getting hands-on experience and understanding it better. And of course there are practical benefits to booting OSes on GPT, I would rather go about it the officially supported way of installing Windows (GPT on UEFI) rather than the methods outlined in your thread (GPT on BIOS). So this is really more of a pet project and a personal interest more than anything. It\u0027s certainly not absolutely necessary to pursue, I could always settle for booting Windows on BIOS/MBR, with the 4 partition limit thing. And I also understand that DUET isn\u0027t even guaranteed to work. But I do have an Intel i7 CPU and presumably a motherboard that might work with DUET, so I\u0027d like to give it a shot anyways. I have read that AMD generally doesn\u0027t work well with DUET, if at all, if that were the case for me I wouldn\u0027t bother.\n\nWell, hopefully I was able to clear some things up now.\n\n"

      "content": "@ alexanderq: I\u0027m not using any bootloader that\u0027s even remotely related to OS X, much less Clover. Grub2 is my preference. If you ask me, OS X is just a prettied-up Unix-like OS with a glorified interface. My dad switched to it after getting fed up with XP years ago, now he absolutely insists that getting a virus on it is impossible, but he just doesn\u0027t understand that you can get malware on any OS. I even tried setting up a Hackintosh dualboot awhile ago, it didn\u0027t go as planned, mainly because the gaming laptop I had then used NVIDIA Optimus graphics technology, and Optimus apparently isn\u0027t compatible with OS X at all. It installed fine, but the system had a kernel panic and couldn\u0027t figure out which video card to use (NVIDIA or the onboard Intel), and so booting couldn\u0027t proceed.\n\nSo, this now leaves me with several choices. Since I will never be able to realize the practical benefits of UEFI on my current hardware, even by emulating it, then maybe DUET makes little sense. But it would still be an interesting experiment nonetheless. I now realize that my real interest is in the benefits of GPT rather than UEFI itself, and so now Milind\u0027s approach is starting to look much more attractive. I\u0027ve always hated the 4 partition limit that BIOS has, and having to separate everything up into primary/logical partitions just to accomodate that limitation.\n\nMy current plan is to install Windows 8.1 and Arch Linux with GRUB2 as the ideal bootloader. Windows will be encrypted with BestCrypt, Arch will ideally have 2 partitions (a root partition and a home partition). Another NTFS partition is also desired so that I can isolate my games from the other partitions, and store my Windows backups. This will allow me to restore Windows with DriveSnapshot or whatever, without having to reinstall games even if reinstalling/repairing Windows becomes necessary. And to boot Windows on a BIOS/GPT config, a BIOS boot partition is required by GRUB. This is where the 4 partition limit becomes a major hassle. I will need a minumum of 5 partitions if I stick to this plan, and GPT is the more clean approach for this. I currently have 750GB to work with, next month I\u0027m going to replace the optical disc slot with an optical disk drive caddy, and shove another 1 to 1.5 TB drive in there for games, etc. This will also give me a way to play around with more OSes and generally have more available space.\n\nFor me it\u0027s basically going to come down to which approach will be easiest and least time-consuming to set up, and which will pose the least potential unforeseen issues in the future. I read milind\u0027s thread and it just got so complicated, and with things splitting off in so many different directions with different methods, so I initially decided to forego his approach. Another issue is that it seems that approach will require a USB drive to boot. I know that it can be done without it but you guys listed way too many approaches to accomplishing that, so I\u0027m confused how to proceed. I will also need a USB (ideally) to set up DUET, which I don\u0027t currently have. I have an app on my phone called DriveDroid that can boot most ISOs, and some IMG files as well. The general idea was to create a DUET floppy img, transfer it to the phone, and boot DUET from there, then find a way to install it on the HDD (probably in the EFI partition, I\u0027m guessing). As for installing Windows, well, I can either use a disc, or create a temp FAT32 partition on the HDD, make it bootable, and install 8.1 into another partition on the same physical drive from there. I was hoping to play around with EFI shells and UEFI variables, etc, to get a feel for how things work, but in the end I just want a usable PC that I can enjoy using instead of fixing \\*\\*\\*\\* all the time. I have a bad habit of crashing my PC and doing risky stuff that forces me to fix stuff alot. On the other hand, I suppose I could play around with UEFI in a VM until I\u0027ve saved enough money to buy what I really want.\n\nI\u0027ll go ahead and issue an apology in advance to Wonko, my previous comments never should have gone as far as they did, and even though I generally don\u0027t give a \\*\\*\\*\\* what people think of me, I also realize it wont bode well for my future reputation on this site if I\u0027m viewed as an \\*\\*\\*hole.\n\nJust thought I\u0027d try to solicit some ideas before proceeding.\n\n"

      "content": "\u003e [https://wiki.archlin...rtition_schemes](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/beginners%27_guide#Partition_schemes \"External link\")  \n\u003e\n\u003e That section of the Arch Wiki says that a BIOS boot partition is needed for GRUB2, to boot Arch on BIOS/GPT. It also says elsewhere in the wiki that Arch must follow the same firmware booting mode as Windows if you plan to dualboot.  \n\u003e\n\u003e Still a bit confused on where to begin and which method to use...  \n\u003e\n\u003e Thanks!\n\nLet\u0027s see if I can clear this aspect.\n\nOn BIOS, and on a MBR disk:\n\nThe \"normal\" way to boot through Syslinux is to have:\n\n* a \"special\" MBR able to load the bootsector of a volume\n* a special bootsector able to load the actual Syslinux loader/bootmanager\n\nThe \"normal\" way to boot through GRUB2 is to have:\n\nGRUB2 installed to the MBR **and to a number of hidden sectors**\n\nthe above installed code is able to load the actual core.img, i.e. the actual GRUB2 loader/bootmanager\n\nThe \"normal\" way to boot through grub4dos is to have:\n\n* grub4dos installed to the MBR **and to a number of hidden sectors**\n* the above installed code is able to load the actual grldr, i.e. the actual grub4dos loader/bootmanager\n\nBUT grub4dos boot can also be configured to have\n\n* a \"special\" MBR able to load the bootsector of a volume\n* a special bootsector able to load the actual actual grldr, i.e. the actual grub4dos loader/bootmanager\n\nSince the *stupid* GPT specifications use ++senselessly++ a few among the hidden sectors and the *stupid* - as often happens diverging from the specifications or plainly ++wrong++ - implementations on different operating systems allow NOT to move these GPT used sectors to other sectors, BOTH \"normal\" installs of GRUB2 and grub4dos cannot work as they generate a conflict when the disk is GPT or \"hybrid MBR/GPT\".\n\nThe Author of Syslinux has developed another MBR code, specific for GPT disks, to load Syslinux, hence the ArchWiki note about it not needing a dedicated partition.\n\nThe developers of GRUB2 have implemented a way making use of a \"special\" **GPT** partition using (or abusing) of the GPT partition ID\u0027s, assigning to it an ID of \"21686148-6449-6e6f-744e656564454649\" i.e. if seen in a hex editor !haHdInotNeedEFI, and calling it - in order to make things more simple - \"BIOS Boot partition\" which when discussed in a context of BIOS vs. UEFI and BIOS/MBR vs. UEFI/GPT can lead the reader to believe that it is a MBR partition and not a **GPT** one.\n\nNow, one of the features of the GPT specifications is to be able to have as much as 128 (actually more) primary (GPT) partitions so it is not at all an issue to have one of the at least 128 available \"slots\" assigned to a small \"BIOS boot partition\" dedicated to GRUB2.\n\nThe mentioned thread contains a lot of related info, that you should digest before making a choice:\n\n[http://reboot.pro/to...in-bios-to-gpt/](http://reboot.pro/topic/19516-hack-bootmgr-to-boot-windows-in-bios-to-gpt/ \"\")\n\nParticularly posts starting from around:\n\n[http://reboot.pro/to...o-gpt/?p\u003d186493](http://reboot.pro/topic/19516-hack-bootmgr-to-boot-windows-in-bios-to-gpt/?p\u003d186493 \"\")\n\nare largely about this common enough confusion with GPT partition ID\u0027s and corresponding \"friendly names\" and how the one (or the other) OS \"sees\" them once booted.\n\nThe proposed alternative solution is that of loading grub4dos through a special MBR code that is NOT a \"hybrid MBR/GPT\" (i.e. the partition table entry remains fully GPT compliant) from a small partition that can be either totally hidden (and not interfering with either BIOS or UEFI access/booting) or made visible in the GPT partition table assigning to it an unused GPT ID (there are so many of them, and I have prer-booked ![:w00t:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/w00t.gif) \"57745348-616C-6640-7373-656450617274\" :wink:) or ***abusing*** of the \"024DEE41-33E7-11D3-9D69-0008C781F39F\" or \"MBR Partition scheme\" ID, which has the advantage that it is part of the UEFI/GPT specs (though aimed to a different use *that never was*) and Windows ignores it.\n\n![:duff:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/duff.gif)\n\nWonko\n\n"

My dad switched to it after getting fed up with XP years ago, now he absolutely insists that getting a virus on it is impossible, but he just doesn\u0027t understand that you can get malware on any OS. I even tried setting up a Hackintosh dualboot awhile ago, it didn\u0027t go as planned, mainly because the gaming laptop I had then used NVIDIA Optimus graphics technology, and Optimus apparently isn\u0027t compatible with OS X at all. It installed fine, but the system had a kernel panic and couldn\u0027t figure out which video card to use (NVIDIA or the onboard Intel), and so booting couldn\u0027t proceed.\n\u003e\n\u003e You do understand that i offered an easy way for booting efi windows on bios allmost as real efi and not something about OSX\n\n"

      "content": "So, I\u0027ve decide to try DUET as the initial approach, since it just seems so interesting and tempting anyway, and will revert to the GPT on BIOS method later if DUET either fails, or succeeds but proves to be problematic. I\u0027ve only waited this long because I don\u0027t have a USB to work with yet, and because of uncertainly in regards to whether it is best to boot DUET as a memdisk image or some other way (the notes in the readme for the DUET download mention that it is out of date and unsupported, and states that a newer method is available).\n\nI decided to give the DUET in VirtualBox a shot today, as suggested by cdob, even though I\u0027m aware that it may not work on my physical hardware even if it can be replicated in VB. I figured getting a little familiarity with the overall process wouldn\u0027t hurt anything. And of course, ran into snags.\n\nWithout a USB, I instead created a VHD on a SATA controller, figuring I could mount it a drive letter, give VB access to that, and boot it as if it were a virtual USB. The first issue, as mentioned in the link by cdob, and quote:\n\n\u003e set drive_letter\u003dg  \n\u003e md %drive_letter%:\\\\\\[boot\\]\\\\syslinux  \n\u003e syslinux.exe --mbr --active --directory /\\[boot\\]/syslinux/ --install %drive_letter%:\n\nI formatted the 5GB VHD as FAT32, and assigned it a drive letter of Z, then copy/pasted the above commands line by line, replacing %drive_letter% with Z. And syslinux.exe complained that the syntax was incorrect. So I used an alternate approach of installing syslinux to USB/VHD (Google). Afterwards I copied tiano.img and memdisk into the given locations, created syslinux.cfg, then attached the VHD to the VM as a virtual HDD. And VirtualBox complained that it was read-only, even though I can manually go to Z and create files/folders.\n\nI\u0027m pretty much stumped at this point.\n\n**Edited by Enigma83, 21 March 2015 - 10:25 PM.**\n"

I\u0027m not sure I understand your post, I\u0027ll try to go back and chew through it a bit at a time (I have to process things that way or else I lose train of thought, and I get distracted easily).\n\n@ cdob: that seems like an excellent approach, but I would still like to get the method listed in your first post working, just for the sake of messing around. It also seems that what you\u0027re suggesting now seems like a hybrid MBR, since you say \"apply syslinux to MBR and EFI partition\". That\u0027s exactly what I want to avoid, if it is indeed as dangerous as \u0027milindsmart\u0027 stated (in his other topic). I would like to stay as close to the UEFI specs as possible, emulated or not. But in the end, whatever works with the least issues will do. I also have no knowledge of how to copy bytes with a hex editor from gptmbr.bin to the MBR, or how to use a hex editor at all, for that matter. I\u0027ve always thought that true GPT partitioning doesn\u0027t have an MBR. I plan to make my EFI partition closer to 500MB or so, since I\u0027m going to be dual-booting multiple OSes (Arch Linux, maybe FreeBSD/PC-BSD, etc). Can you also clarify whether you were successful with wimboot, or a raw floppy, since posts #35 and #37 from the topic you linked aren\u0027t clarified?\n\nAs if that weren\u0027t enough, I\u0027d also like to encrypt Windows and, eventually, Linux. I\u0027m going to be using BestCrypt Volume Encryption, since it\u0027s currently the only thing that works with UEFI. I suspect it might also work with DUET. Others like TrueCrypt, VeraCrypt, DiskCryptor, etc, only work with MBR. I would like to avoid proprietary solutions in the long run, but I\u0027ve had no major issues with BC thusfar. Maybe I\u0027m complicating things a bit too much with this one, but I\u0027ve always been one to push limits and do crazy stuff to/with my PC that most others won\u0027t try.\n\nNot having a USB handy is really hampering me, once I get an optical disk drive caddy in a week or so I\u0027ll have more space to work with, and more potential booting methods. It too will be GPT, primarily for storing data, not OSes. And the notebook\u0027s primary HDD will be replaced with an SSD, testing indicates that the current HDD should be fine for awhile longer, but may die soon. I know that GPT is better for SSDs than MBR.\n\nMy last issue is that I would like to make the transition from MBR to UEFI without having to reinstall Windows. I think that making a compressed backup with Drive Snapshot or TeraByte Image for Windows and then restoring it to the Windows system partition (not EFI, obviously) should work, as long as I recreate the proper boot files in the EFI? I\u0027ll probably just convert my current partition table with gptgen, then resize the beginning of the disk to make room for the EFI.\n\nThanks!\n\n**Edited by Enigma83, 25 March 2015 - 09:18 AM.**\n"

I have heard of a \u0027GPT protective partition\u0027, but that implies an actual partition, and I presume it\u0027s not the same as the EFI partition. Your Wikipedia link states \"In a GPT, the first sector of the disk is reserved for a \"protective MBR\" such that booting a BIOS-based computer from a GPT disk is supported, but the boot loader and operating system must both be GPT-aware. Regardless of the sector size, the GPT header begins on the second logical block of the device.\" So it sounds as if the first first 440 bytes of gptmbr.bin need to be copied to the first sector of the HDD in a hex editor (after the GPT partition table is created, which I will use GParted to do).\n\nAnd then you posted this:\n\u003e\n\u003e # Boot Windows7 from floppy  \n\u003e LABEL Windows7  \n\u003e LINUX memdisk  \n\u003e INITRD W7.img  \n\u003e APPEND raw\n\nWhere did you get the floppy image from?

If my hardware did support UEFI, DUET wouldn\u0027t be a consideration, and I wouldn\u0027t be posting here at all.\n\nAnd besides all of that, UEFI is slowly becoming the future for booting computers. BIOS is dying out. UEFI\u0027s bugs are being ironed out. What you guys were trying to do, seemed at best an interesting yet complicated project, yet still fighting against the tide in a losing battle.\n\nAlso, I succinctly stated that my hardware doesn\u0027t support UEFI in any way whatsoever. No options in the BIOS for \"legacy/compatibility\" mode, \"Secure Boot\", etc. Perhaps you you could have taken my word for it and we could have worked from there.\n\nWith all that said, if your only purpose in posting in my thread is to attempt to convince me that the approach in the thread you linked is the best way for me to proceed, then please kindly move along, I\u0027m not interested. But if you\u0027re interested in helping me get DUET set up, then you\u0027re welcome to continue this line of conversation with me. I apologize if I sound rude or standoffish, I can be that way sometimes without being aware of it or meaning to do it, so take it how you want.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n"

      "content": "Despite the offensive level of aggression that was entirely unneeded, I think a few things need to be cleared up (which Wonko might have explained if you hadn\u0027t lost your cool like a rabid shrew).  \n\nUEFI is a \\*firmware\\* interface - it is a superior way of interacting with the hardware as compared to BIOS. The vast majority of the point of UEFI is to establish a baseline functionality in the machine that an operating system or boot-time utility can utilise and build on.  \n\nWhen UEFI is not present, much of the benefits of the firmware interface are lost if you emulate it : it will still ultimately start up through a 512-byte boot sector, which also (can) contain 4 partitions squeezed in, along with a measly 4-byte disk signature.  \n\nThere can still be some benefit to using emulated UEFI as a way to let all OSes start from a uniform platform, but I\u0027m unaware of the existence of any other concrete OR theoretical benefits. Meanwhile this approach causes the OS to depend on the UEFI implementation, which is a GENERIC application meant to be customised further for actual hardware. Using a tianocore reference implementation with a real hardware board with no customisation for your machine sounds like a pointless abstraction.   \n"

      "content": "Perhaps this topic got off on the wrong foot, although I prefer to think of it as a misunderstanding. At this point I was about ready to just forget about this DUET thing and move on. But I don\u0027t give up so easily, and, DUET or not, I wasn\u0027t about to let this topic die without at least clarifying a few things. So..........\n\nWhat you guys see as agressiveness, actually isn\u0027t. I just felt that Wonko was asking an unnecessary question, which was, in a nutshell, that he had asked to me explain the benefits of GPT. I took that as him asking me as a way to try to get an insight into why I\u0027m pursuing this, i.e. questioning my motivations. In tech forums, motivations generally don\u0027t matter, it is the knowledge that matters, and those 2 things are entirely separate from each other. Knowledge is one thing, what one does with that knowledge is his own business. And I clearly have no unethical motivations here (or at least it should be fairly obvious, anyway).\n\n2nd, as of his first post, I felt really had no intention of advising how I could accomplish a DUET setup, but rather that he was really only planning to ask questions and try to convince/explain to me why I shouldn\u0027t bother going about this. I already have my mind made up, help or no help, and I\u0027m of the opinion that an individual really has no business posting in a topic if he has no useful info to contribute right from the get-go, without questioning or trying to convince otherwise, etc. If there is nothing that can be contributed, then it\u0027s best to refrain from posting in the topic at all.\n\nTo give you a better oversight of how I think, it goes something like this:\n\n1. Person A asks question\n\n2. Person B comes along, know\u0027s the answer to A\u0027s question, or possesses other info that can at least help bring about a solution. If on the other hand B has no relevant info or has other intentions, etc, then it\u0027s best for him/her to not post at all.\n\nThings really are that simple to me, I\u0027m a straightforward, no-BS type of guy, and I have no patience for runarounds and beating around the bush with people. I tend to get annoyed by others very easily, and prefer not to deal with them at all if it can be avoided.\n\n@ Wonko: You can look at going beyond the 2.2TB limit as a need rather than a benefit, in this world everything is a matter of perspective. HDDs/storage are getting ever bigger these days, so in reality being able to use disks larger than 2.2TB really is a benefit. You have a very strange definition of \"senseless feature\".\n\n@ Milind: I\u0027m well aware that UEFI is a firmware interface, in much the same way that BIOS is a firmware interface of sorts, albeit much older. I also understand UEFI is probably largely useless in hardware such as mine, which doesn\u0027t natively support it. I\u0027m not concerned about losing benefits, I really have nothing to lose, and knowledge to gain.\n\nSo, I\u0027ll go ahead and give you and Wonko a roundabout explanation of why I\u0027m doing this. As of a few months ago, I had always booted all OSes in BIOS/MBR mode. But then I made the jump to UEFI, after reading up on the benefits of UEFI and GPT and clearing up a few misconceptions I had (such as, Secure Boot and UEFI are one and the same, they obviously arent, but I didnt understand this until recently. I had numerous issues dualbooting with Linux as a result of this, and viewed SB as a PITA to be avoided at all costs). But anyways, long story short, my old PC grew legs and walked away, so now I\u0027m temporarily stuck with older hardware until I can buy something much better.\n\nI also like to learn, and I\u0027m determined to continue using UEFI or some form of it on my current hardware, even if it\u0027s only emulated, for the purpose of getting hands-on experience and understanding it better. And of course there are practical benefits to booting OSes on GPT, I would rather go about it the officially supported way of installing Windows (GPT on UEFI) rather than the methods outlined in your thread (GPT on BIOS). So this is really more of a pet project and a personal interest more than anything. It\u0027s certainly not absolutely necessary to pursue, I could always settle for booting Windows on BIOS/MBR, with the 4 partition limit thing. And I also understand that DUET isn\u0027t even guaranteed to work. But I do have an Intel i7 CPU and presumably a motherboard that might work with DUET, so I\u0027d like to give it a shot anyways. I have read that AMD generally doesn\u0027t work well with DUET, if at all, if that were the case for me I wouldn\u0027t bother.\n\nWell, hopefully I was able to clear some things up now.\n\n"

      "content": "@ alexanderq: I\u0027m not using any bootloader that\u0027s even remotely related to OS X, much less Clover. Grub2 is my preference. If you ask me, OS X is just a prettied-up Unix-like OS with a glorified interface. My dad switched to it after getting fed up with XP years ago, now he absolutely insists that getting a virus on it is impossible, but he just doesn\u0027t understand that you can get malware on any OS. I even tried setting up a Hackintosh dualboot awhile ago, it didn\u0027t go as planned, mainly because the gaming laptop I had then used NVIDIA Optimus graphics technology, and Optimus apparently isn\u0027t compatible with OS X at all. It installed fine, but the system had a kernel panic and couldn\u0027t figure out which video card to use (NVIDIA or the onboard Intel), and so booting couldn\u0027t proceed.\n\nSo, this now leaves me with several choices. Since I will never be able to realize the practical benefits of UEFI on my current hardware, even by emulating it, then maybe DUET makes little sense. But it would still be an interesting experiment nonetheless. I now realize that my real interest is in the benefits of GPT rather than UEFI itself, and so now Milind\u0027s approach is starting to look much more attractive. I\u0027ve always hated the 4 partition limit that BIOS has, and having to separate everything up into primary/logical partitions just to accomodate that limitation.\n\nMy current plan is to install Windows 8.1 and Arch Linux with GRUB2 as the ideal bootloader. Windows will be encrypted with BestCrypt, Arch will ideally have 2 partitions (a root partition and a home partition). Another NTFS partition is also desired so that I can isolate my games from the other partitions, and store my Windows backups. This will allow me to restore Windows with DriveSnapshot or whatever, without having to reinstall games even if reinstalling/repairing Windows becomes necessary. And to boot Windows on a BIOS/GPT config, a BIOS boot partition is required by GRUB. This is where the 4 partition limit becomes a major hassle. I will need a minumum of 5 partitions if I stick to this plan, and GPT is the more clean approach for this. I currently have 750GB to work with, next month I\u0027m going to replace the optical disc slot with an optical disk drive caddy, and shove another 1 to 1.5 TB drive in there for games, etc. This will also give me a way to play around with more OSes and generally have more available space.\n\nFor me it\u0027s basically going to come down to which approach will be easiest and least time-consuming to set up, and which will pose the least potential unforeseen issues in the future. I read milind\u0027s thread and it just got so complicated, and with things splitting off in so many different directions with different methods, so I initially decided to forego his approach. Another issue is that it seems that approach will require a USB drive to boot. I know that it can be done without it but you guys listed way too many approaches to accomplishing that, so I\u0027m confused how to proceed. I will also need a USB (ideally) to set up DUET, which I don\u0027t currently have. I have an app on my phone called DriveDroid that can boot most ISOs, and some IMG files as well. The general idea was to create a DUET floppy img, transfer it to the phone, and boot DUET from there, then find a way to install it on the HDD (probably in the EFI partition, I\u0027m guessing). As for installing Windows, well, I can either use a disc, or create a temp FAT32 partition on the HDD, make it bootable, and install 8.1 into another partition on the same physical drive from there. I was hoping to play around with EFI shells and UEFI variables, etc, to get a feel for how things work, but in the end I just want a usable PC that I can enjoy using instead of fixing \\*\\*\\*\\* all the time. I have a bad habit of crashing my PC and doing risky stuff that forces me to fix stuff alot. On the other hand, I suppose I could play around with UEFI in a VM until I\u0027ve saved enough money to buy what I really want.\n\nI\u0027ll go ahead and issue an apology in advance to Wonko, my previous comments never should have gone as far as they did, and even though I generally don\u0027t give a \\*\\*\\*\\* what people think of me, I also realize it wont bode well for my future reputation on this site if I\u0027m viewed as an \\*\\*\\*hole.\n\nJust thought I\u0027d try to solicit some ideas before proceeding.\n\n"

      "content": "So, I\u0027ve decide to try DUET as the initial approach, since it just seems so interesting and tempting anyway, and will revert to the GPT on BIOS method later if DUET either fails, or succeeds but proves to be problematic. I\u0027ve only waited this long because I don\u0027t have a USB to work with yet, and because of uncertainly in regards to whether it is best to boot DUET as a memdisk image or some other way (the notes in the readme for the DUET download mention that it is out of date and unsupported, and states that a newer method is available).\n\nI decided to give the DUET in VirtualBox a shot today, as suggested by cdob, even though I\u0027m aware that it may not work on my physical hardware even if it can be replicated in VB. I figured getting a little familiarity with the overall process wouldn\u0027t hurt anything. And of course, ran into snags.\n\nWithout a USB, I instead created a VHD on a SATA controller, figuring I could mount it a drive letter, give VB access to that, and boot it as if it were a virtual USB. The first issue, as mentioned in the link by cdob, and quote:\n\n\u003e set drive_letter\u003dg  \n\u003e md %drive_letter%:\\\\\\[boot\\]\\\\syslinux  \n\u003e syslinux.exe --mbr --active --directory /\\[boot\\]/syslinux/ --install %drive_letter%:\n\nI formatted the 5GB VHD as FAT32, and assigned it a drive letter of Z, then copy/pasted the above commands line by line, replacing %drive_letter% with Z. And syslinux.exe complained that the syntax was incorrect. So I used an alternate approach of installing syslinux to USB/VHD (Google). Afterwards I copied tiano.img and memdisk into the given locations, created syslinux.cfg, then attached the VHD to the VM as a virtual HDD. And VirtualBox complained that it was read-only, even though I can manually go to Z and create files/folders.\n\nI\u0027m pretty much stumped at this point.\n\n**Edited by Enigma83, 21 March 2015 - 10:25 PM.**\n"

I\u0027m not sure I understand your post, I\u0027ll try to go back and chew through it a bit at a time (I have to process things that way or else I lose train of thought, and I get distracted easily).\n\n@ cdob: that seems like an excellent approach, but I would still like to get the method listed in your first post working, just for the sake of messing around. It also seems that what you\u0027re suggesting now seems like a hybrid MBR, since you say \"apply syslinux to MBR and EFI partition\". That\u0027s exactly what I want to avoid, if it is indeed as dangerous as \u0027milindsmart\u0027 stated (in his other topic). I would like to stay as close to the UEFI specs as possible, emulated or not. But in the end, whatever works with the least issues will do. I also have no knowledge of how to copy bytes with a hex editor from gptmbr.bin to the MBR, or how to use a hex editor at all, for that matter. I\u0027ve always thought that true GPT partitioning doesn\u0027t have an MBR. I plan to make my EFI partition closer to 500MB or so, since I\u0027m going to be dual-booting multiple OSes (Arch Linux, maybe FreeBSD/PC-BSD, etc). Can you also clarify whether you were successful with wimboot, or a raw floppy, since posts #35 and #37 from the topic you linked aren\u0027t clarified?\n\nAs if that weren\u0027t enough, I\u0027d also like to encrypt Windows and, eventually, Linux. I\u0027m going to be using BestCrypt Volume Encryption, since it\u0027s currently the only thing that works with UEFI. I suspect it might also work with DUET. Others like TrueCrypt, VeraCrypt, DiskCryptor, etc, only work with MBR. I would like to avoid proprietary solutions in the long run, but I\u0027ve had no major issues with BC thusfar. Maybe I\u0027m complicating things a bit too much with this one, but I\u0027ve always been one to push limits and do crazy stuff to/with my PC that most others won\u0027t try.\n\nNot having a USB handy is really hampering me, once I get an optical disk drive caddy in a week or so I\u0027ll have more space to work with, and more potential booting methods. It too will be GPT, primarily for storing data, not OSes. And the notebook\u0027s primary HDD will be replaced with an SSD, testing indicates that the current HDD should be fine for awhile longer, but may die soon. I know that GPT is better for SSDs than MBR.\n\nMy last issue is that I would like to make the transition from MBR to UEFI without having to reinstall Windows. I think that making a compressed backup with Drive Snapshot or TeraByte Image for Windows and then restoring it to the Windows system partition (not EFI, obviously) should work, as long as I recreate the proper boot files in the EFI? I\u0027ll probably just convert my current partition table with gptgen, then resize the beginning of the disk to make room for the EFI.\n\nThanks!\n\n**Edited by Enigma83, 25 March 2015 - 09:18 AM.**\n"

But it says to copy it to HDD MBR. I know you mentioned a GPT protective MBR. But exactly where is this located? I have heard of a \u0027GPT protective partition\u0027, but that implies an actual partition, and I presume it\u0027s not the same as the EFI partition. Your Wikipedia link states \"In a GPT, the first sector of the disk is reserved for a \"protective MBR\" such that booting a BIOS-based computer from a GPT disk is supported, but the boot loader and operating system must both be GPT-aware. Regardless of the sector size, the GPT header begins on the second logical block of the device.\" So it sounds as if the first first 440 bytes of gptmbr.bin need to be copied to the first sector of the HDD in a hex editor (after the GPT partition table is created, which I will use GParted to do).\n\nAnd then you posted this:\n\u003e\n\u003e # Boot Windows7 from floppy  \n\u003e LABEL Windows7  \n\u003e LINUX memdisk  \n\u003e INITRD W7.img  \n\u003e APPEND raw\n\nWhere did you get the floppy image from?

      "content": "There \\*does\\* seem to be a difference in game performance in the past few days, since I made the conversion from MBR to GPT. Not in every game, mainly MMOs, and it is noticable. Namely, in H1Z1, DayZ Standalone, Arma 2/DayZ Mod, and several others (both online and single player) I get momentary lag spikes. I\u0027m not sure if this is a network connection issue or due to my graphics settings. I am not arrogant enough or ignorant enough to think that a 4 yr old laptop, Alienware or not, can continue to play the latest games on high/ultra or even medium settings in some cases, so graphics settings in each game are adjusted to give reasonable/playable performance. I have serious doubts in regards to whether Grand Theft Auto V, which I recently pre-ordered on Steam and is due out for worldwide release on PC on 4-15, will be playable on my system, even though I do just barely meet the minumum requirements. The lags spikes are characterized by momentary times when my character will simply freeze for a split second, this happens at somewhere between 10 to 30 seconds at a time. And then he will return to normal. At other times it doesnt happen at all. I am using the same video drivers as before, alway the latest, and the same build of Windows 8.1 Pro, with all the latest drivers and Windows Updates installed, and the bare minumum # of needed softwares. I make sure before running any game that no unneeded processes/services are running in the background. Before the switchover, the situation was the same, but with no lag spikes at any time.\n\nI am deeply convinced that this is due to drivers rather than to DUET, since if Wonko\u0027s assertion is correct that Windows only uses the HAL once the initial booting stages are complete, then UEFI, or lack thereof, should have absolutely no effect in regards to game performance. I\u0027ll try rolling back to a slightly older NVIDIA driver, and wait until they release a new one, which is around once per month. Even after 4 yrs, I\u0027m surprised that they still continue to put out regular updates for my card model.\n\n**Edited by AnonVendetta, 07 April 2015 - 04:10 AM.**\n"

      "content": "I\u0027ve made a new discovery, one that completely invalidates any reason for me to continue using DUET..........my system was UEFI-capable all along, I just didn\u0027t know it. It was hidden in the BIOS by the bastards at Dell. And I do mean very well hidden, to the point that you basically have to flash a modded BIOS to enable UEFI. It\u0027s well known that manufacturers of notebook PCs typically hide some options in the BIOS from their customers, especially the more advanced stuff like overclocking, etc. In my case, the options to enable UEFI were hidden. I suspect it was because Dell believed that UEFI wouldn\u0027t be advantageous to most customers, especially in a 2011 model like mine. Back then UEFI was relatively new and not yet deployed en masse by most manufucturers. So, the logical conclusion is that my hardware was UEFI-capable all along, they simply chose to hide the option to enable it, preventing everyone except the most advanced customers from discovering it (BIOS hackers). Unlocking a BIOS just involves unhiding options that were hidden by the manufacturer, in my case many options. I was astounded by the amount of new, advanced options that showed up after flashing the modded BIOS at [http://forum.techinf....html#post12003](http://forum.techinferno.com/alienware-m14x-aw-14/561-%5Bmod%5D-voltage-increase-nvidia-gt-555m-7.html#post12003 \"External link\") (M14xR1_A08_\\[unlocked\\]_voltmod_incl_GF116_\\\u0026_SATA_fix.zip is what I used), which is another variant of the BIOSes at [http://forum.techinf...8-sata-fix.html](http://forum.techinferno.com/alienware-m14x-aw-14/1786-m14x-r1-bios-a08-sata-fix.html \"External link\"). The BIOS I used also includes a SATA speed fix, Dell\u0027s chimp tech crews also apparently saw fit to artificially throttle the SATA speeds in the later versions of the M14X R1 BIOSes. I\u0027ve already tested with a few tools like CrystalDiskMark, there is a very noticable difference.\n\nI tested booting with a few UEFI-capable discs. Arch Linux was the first, using the \u0027efivar -l\u0027 command properly listed the UEFI variables (making sure that I had totally bypassed booting via DUET, for accurate results). Next I\u0027m going to test installing Windows 10 TP, to see if it will install in UEFI mode without DUET. Windows 8.1 BSODed when trying to launch the disc setup in UEFI mode on the first try, the 2nd time I managed to make it to the disk selection/formatting screen, but choosing not to proceed until I could migrate my data to an external HDD. That\u0027s an indication that native UEFI may prove to be buggy/flaky for me.\n\nI also noticed that there is the presence of a UEFI shell v1 and v2 in Arch\u0027s boot disc menu (couldn\u0027t find a screenshot to link to), my system can launch shell v1 but not shell v2. And [https://wiki.archlin...ning_UEFI_Shell](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface#Obtaining_UEFI_Shell \"External link\") says that \"Shell v2 works best in UEFI 2.3+ systems and is recommended over Shell v1 in those systems. Shell v1 should work in all UEFI systems irrespective of the spec. version the firmware follows.\" Does this mean that I have a pre-UEFI firmware v2.3 system? Perhaps someone with UEFI experience can answer this. I\u0027m not sure what the difference is but plan to look into it.\n\nLastly my BIOS not only seems to have an option that allows UEFI to either be enabled or disabled (disabled is default). But there is another option that allows the user to give preference to legacy boot or UEFI booting mode. If legacy is chosen then UEFI can still be enabled, but any OS installed in legacy mode will have first priority to boot (if any exist) and presumably will be automatically chosen first. If UEFI is chosen then the situation apparently will be the other way around. I\u0027ll have to play around to see if it works. I know that Linux can be booted in either legacy or UEFI mode, not sure about Windows. Maybe this option will enable this scenario for Windows? Or is it an all or nothing proposition (if installed in UEFI mode then it must always be used for booting, if installed in legacy mode then it must be used instead)? I ask this because the TechNet article for bcdboot ([https://technet.micr...7(v\u003dws.10).aspx](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd744347%28v\u003dws.10%29.aspx \"External link\")) allows to install the boot files with the variables \"UEFI, BIOS, or ALL\". UEFI is for UEFI booting, BIOS is for legacy booting, and the \u0027all\u0027 variable installs boot files for \\*both\\* booting in either UEFI or legacy mode. The options must be manually entered at a CMD/MS-DOS prompt. This implies that I may be able to choose, considering my BIOS apparently allows for booting in this way.\n\nAnd, if the above really is the case, how can I best set up my system to allow all OSes to boot in either mode (maybe not Windows, I\u0027ll see as this discussion moves along). Leaving both options open would be nice, in case of issues.\n\nI think I\u0027ll make a post on the AW owners forum to let legacy hardware owners (of the M14X R1) know that they can enable UEFI with a modded BIOS, instead of using DUET or milind\u0027s approach. Although a admin/mod may very well delete it for referencing/linking to unofficial BIOSes.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n**Edited by AnonVendetta, 07 April 2015 - 09:31 AM.**\n"

Something would have to chainload GRUB2 in the BBP, whether that something be Syslinux or whatever else in the protective MBR.

So, anyway.......\n\nI had suspected that I could use the EFI partition for both UEFI and BIOS booting, since my PC\u0027s seems to imply that it\u0027s possible. Unless there\u0027s some other info Wonko hasn\u0027t made known. To clarify, I\u0027d like to test real UEFI booting (already tested without DUET a few hours ago, it works fine and Windows installs/boots in UEFI mode), while leaving open the possibility of \\*ALSO\\* booting Windows in BIOS mode as well. Which is where milind\u0027s approach will be useful. I neither need nor have to do this, I\u0027m just doing it because I can. For the learning experience. I could just continue booting in UEFI mode and forget all this. This thread wasn\u0027t entirely useless, at the time I originally posted I really believed that real UEFI wasn\u0027t possible on my hardware, since the BIOS made mention of it nowhere. But now that I know the truth, I do still feel that I\u0027ve learned a bit, so not an entirely useless thread. I\u0027ll still post my exact instructions later. I might even install DUET in the EFI/protective MBR anyway, just to continue playing with it.\n\nCdob, did you bother to read my above posts? I have no need for DUET anymore, it turns out Dell had hidden my BIOS\u0027s UEFI functionally in menus that only become visible if you flash a hacked BIOS (what I did). My motherboard was capable of UEFI all along, Dell just left on/off switch hidden, to the point that only advanced users would find it. None of their official BIOSes for my model mention UEFI anywhere. The last BIOS release was A08, and that was several years ago. Did you ever get around to trying Rod Smith\u0027s DUET approach? Follow it to a tee, see if your AMD is still unable to boot. He does also mention that some people will need to use the slightly older EDK duet-install, which doesn\u0027t support AHCI (only IDE, I think). There is a switch for it in the DUET-install scripts, by default the script installs whatever the newest is (what I used). That may work for you.\n\nI know about the fast startup thing, it cause problems in Linux, Linux can only access the Windows volume in read only only, since it\u0027s in a sort of hibernation/sleep. Disabling fast startup stops that. It\u0027s another UEFI feature that\u0027s nice if you only use Windows, but I personally have no need for it.\n\nThanks for the booting tips, I\u0027m going to see if your advice would work for booting Windows in BIOS mode on GPT. But I don\u0027t think it will, I\u0027ll probably have to resort to using one of the floppy-variant methods for BIOS booting.\n\nAs for the RAM upgrade, I know 8GB is what is officially supported by Dell on my PC. I\u0027ll have to research if 16GB is possible. My main interest is in being able to install a game or 2 in a RAM drive for faster performance (and faster than running them from an SSD, too). But I could care less what the manufacturers want me to do with my electronics, or what they support. Support or no supports, if something works, then it just does. When I buy hardware, I have the full expectation that I can and will do what I wish with it, since it is my personal property. I already root all my Android phones and do asinine stuff on my PCs that most others wont try.\n\nMy processor is an i7, I\u0027m pretty sure I have 2 memory slots.\n\n"

      "content": "@ Wonko: Thanks for the info.\n\n@ Cdob, I\u0027m not sure you completely understand what I\u0027m saying. Yes I read your post and I get your point. However, \\*my\\* post was an attempt to convey the message that the unlocked BIOS mod I flashed \\*also\\* enabled the hidden (by Dell) UEFI options. So now UEFI is real and native for me, no more DUET emulation required (unless I choose to continue messing with it, of course) . So now I can choose to boot in UEFI both natively or with DUET. I was mostly contesting the part where you said \"Full features, like fast startup, requires UEFI at GPT.  \nUse DUET. Chainloaded by Syslinux/GRUB2/grub4dos.\" This implied that you hadn\u0027t quite gotten the point of my previous posts. With native UEFI capabilities, DUET becomes unnecessary. Nor would I need to chainload DUET, now that I know the truth. And this, \"Hence you may use simplified BIOS/GPT without EFI emulation\". Not sure what that is supposed to mean, and how it relates to the (seemingly contradictory) sentences immediately preceding it. In one sentence you say I can use DUET and chainload it, but in the next few lines you seem to imply that I can use simplified BIOS/GPT without emulation. For one, DUET is technically BIOS/GPT, given that booting will start from a 512 byte boot sector before DUET. But to your OSes you are in UEFI/GPT mode. And DUET is obviously emulation designed to lie to the OSes about the booting mode.  \nAnd \"Of course you are free to ignore this and use BIOS GPT boot.\" I\u0027m not free to ignore that, for UEFI I will either need to use my PC\u0027s native capabilities or DUET, for BIOS/GPT I\u0027ll have to use the floppy variants approach to boot the same Windows install in that mode.\n\nObviously the native option is the best route, and it works, already tested with Windows 10 and Arch Linux.

I already got it working (and have decided to keep it to play around, while still mainly booting in native UEFI), only to discover it\u0027s not needed.\n\nIt\u0027s already established that booting in BIOS mode will require some sort of floppy, unless someone has another innovative idea (which should be posted in milind\u0027s thread instead of here).\n\nMy only concern is that Windows will not be able to find/update its\u0027 boot files with a floppy method, if it needs to do so for whatever reason. It seems to be a read-only approach. And with wimboot the boot files vanish after Windows is booted. This is possible on real BIOS/MBR, and I feel it is a valid concern not addressed in Milind\u0027s thread.\n\nI\u0027m thinking that maybe something like a dedicated MBR partition on GPT would work best, kind of similar to GRUB\u0027s BIOS boot partition. This also reduces the possibility of accidental tampering by other tools. How can this be done? As another idea, maybe I can just use bcdboot\u0027s \u0027all\u0027 parameter and let the BIOS boot files live in the EFI alongside the UEFI boot files, in their own folder.\n\nI suppose this thread should be left open for discussion of DUET and helping others who might need assistance with it in the future. I still think it\u0027s interesting enough to keep playing with.\n\nI\u0027m also interested in whether cdob has managed to get DUET working on his AMD board, and hopefully/eventually getting it to boot, if he plans to pursue it. Rod Smith\u0027s instructions should be tried first, then maybe Clover/XPC, etc.It\u0027s clear that what worked for me won\u0027t work for him.

I\u0027ll either have to run in BIOS mode on MBR, try milind\u0027s BIOS on GPT approach, or find another 1TB SSD that works. It may be recognized by my BIOS\u0027s UEFI, or only in legacy, or not at all. I haven\u0027t made a purchase yet, but prefer not to have to return a product if it might not work.\n\n"

      "content": "\u003e It\u0027s already established that booting in BIOS mode will require some sort of floppy, unless someone has another innovative idea (which should be posted in milind\u0027s thread instead of here).  \n\u003e\n\u003e My only concern is that Windows will not be able to find/update its\u0027 boot files with a floppy method, if it needs to do so for whatever reason. It seems to be a read-only approach. And with wimboot the boot files vanish after Windows is booted. This is possible on real BIOS/MBR, and I feel it is a valid concern not addressed in Milind\u0027s thread.  \n\u003e\n\u003e I\u0027m thinking that maybe something like a dedicated MBR partition on GPT would work best, kind of similar to GRUB\u0027s BIOS boot partition. This also reduces the possibility of accidental tampering by other tools. How can this be done? As another idea, maybe I can just use bcdboot\u0027s \u0027all\u0027 parameter and let the BIOS boot files live in the EFI alongside the UEFI boot files, in their own folder.\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nWhy don\u0027 t you try to actually UNDERSTAND what we have been saying till now?\n\nDid you try to research on what is involved in the method cdob suggested to you?  \n[http://reboot.pro/to...e-3#entry191914](http://reboot.pro/topic/20359-need-help-setting-up-uefi-duet-on-alienware-m14x-r1/page-3#entry191914 \"\")  \n\nRelevant snippets:  \n\u003e No, one FAT32 partition can serve both \\\\boot and \\\\efi.\n\u003e Hence you may use simplified BIOS/GPT without EFI emulation.  \n\u003e Grub2 is limited. How to map a partition to satisfy bootmgr (working bcd)? Grub4dos can do this.  \n\u003e Take both. Install your preference grub2 to hard disk, and chainload grub4dos grub.exe  \n\u003e\n\u003e Search and find bootmgr at same hard disk, launch files from FAT32 EFI partition\n\u003e\n\u003e ```\n\u003e title GPT BIOS bootmgr\n\u003e #bcdboot.exe c:\\windows /s S: /f BIOS\n\u003e cat --length\u003d0 (,0)/bootmgr \u0026\u0026 map (,0)+1 (fd0)\n\u003e cat --length\u003d0 (,1)/bootmgr \u0026\u0026 map (,1)+1 (fd0)\n\u003e cat --length\u003d0 (,2)/bootmgr \u0026\u0026 map (,2)+1 (fd0)\n\u003e cat --length\u003d0 (,3)/bootmgr \u0026\u0026 map (,3)+1 (fd0)\n\u003e map --hook\n\u003e root (fd0)\n\u003e chainloader /bootmgr\n\u003e ```\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nThe idea is to boot GRUB2 (that can boot **BOTH** in **BIOS** and **UEFI)** then use the **SAME** FAT32 \"EFI\" partition for **BOTH** **BIOS** boot files (BOOTMGR and \\\\boot\\\\BCD) and **UEFI**Windows boot files .  \nWhen **UEFI** these can be chainloaded directly from GRUB2.  \nWhen **BIOS** you need to chainload grub4dos, and from it map the **SAME** FAT32 \"EFI\" partition as first floppy and chainload the BOOTMGR.  \n\nWhich parts are not clear to you? ![:unsure:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/unsure.png)  \n\n![:duff:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/duff.gif)  \nWonko\n\n"
