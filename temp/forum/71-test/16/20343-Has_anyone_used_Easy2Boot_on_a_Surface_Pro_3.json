Then boot it using QEMU or VBox or on a Legacy system and select the Clonezilla .imgPTN menu to get to the CSM menu. Then unplug it and try to boot it from your Surface Pro..\n\n"

It also had a ENABLE USB BOOT or some such choice as well. I had to enable that to get to the boot as it did the same thing your Surface Pro did, never detected the USB drive as a bootable media.\n\n"

I\u0027m going to have to make an .imgPTN of my 64 bit PE ISOs in case I run into one of these devices that just won\u0027t do CSM at all.\n\nCuriously the article states that Windows 7 is not UEFI compatible, I\u0027ve installed it via UEFI quite a few times. I\u0027ve also noticed that at least the Win 7 64 ISO I have lacks the proper \\\\efi\\\\boot\\\\bootx64.efi file so I borrowed one from a Windows 8.1 OS ISO and inserted it into the ISO. I do see little benefit of the UEFI boot method on a PC with a drive less than 2 TB though and normally just use MBR.\n\n"
