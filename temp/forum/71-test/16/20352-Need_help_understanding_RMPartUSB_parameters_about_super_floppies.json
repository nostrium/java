(FACT).  \n\nSince a ZIP is NOTHING but a beefy floppy or single platter hard disk in a fancy cartridge, internally it can have ONLY (just like a floppy) 2 (two) \"sides\" or \"heads\", anything different is a \"faked\" geometry, it is well possible that the specific ZIP IDE Insider model faked a 512\\*12\\*32 CHS geometry (which does result in 196608), and that a given (crappy) BIOS\u0027 LBA translation made it into a 97/32/63 one (that results into 195552 ![:w00t:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/w00t.gif) ![:ph34r:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/scared9.gif)), BUT ALL OTHER ZIP DRIVES 100 Mb EVER EXAMINED ALL OVER THE WORLD do expose a geometry of 96/64/32 (which also does result as 196608 sectors) OR (another singularity) 1024/4/48 (but that anyway results as 196608 sectors), the correct references were already given.  \n\nThe ZIP IDE Insider was produced (in relatively small quantities) in 1996 or 1997 and was quickly replaced by the various ATAPI versions, or, if you prefer, any NON SCSI, NON Parallel, NON USB ZIP produced since at least late 1997 or early 1998 is one of the three ATAPI versions, and BIOSes were adapted to work with those, it would be an extremely rare case that you will ever come across a BIOS that creates the crazy LBA translation that the mentioned KB discusses.  \n\n![:duff:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/duff.gif)  \n\nWonko   \n"
