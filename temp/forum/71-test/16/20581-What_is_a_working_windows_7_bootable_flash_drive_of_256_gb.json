This will allow you to assign drive letter C to your target partition.  \n\nYou can also try to create a Windows To Go USB, I think it\u0027s only available to be created with Win8/8.1 Enterprise, but there are workarounds to create it from another Windows OS.  \n\nYou can install whatever Windows you want, but 8.1 will be the best and fastest for your purposes.
