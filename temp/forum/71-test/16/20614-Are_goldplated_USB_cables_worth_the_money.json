      "content": "I ask this because I have had several USB cables \u0027burn out\u0027 on me in the past few months, and all were relatively new. Certainly there is some variation in the quality of cables by various manufacturers. I\u0027m specifically referring to USB 3.0 cables, since these can serve a dual purpose for use with my external drives, as well as charging my phones and letting me copy data from them to PC and vice versa.\n\nIt is common knowledge that gold is an excellent conductor of electricity, and I figure that it may also be better for maintaining a consistent and stable data transfer rates. Or is the qualiity of the cord itself (not the tip) the main factor, since that is where the data must \u0027flow\u0027?\n\nIf gold is indeed better, who are the best manufacturers/suppliers? 3 feet is the minumum I\u0027d need, but 5 feet is a better length.\n\n"

      "content": "It seems that every cable I connect to my PC/phone simply stops working after a short time. Maybe there is something wrong with my PC that is causing this\n\nI also use a custom kernel with my Note 3 (Yank555), it supports a feature called \u0027USB fast charge\u0027. Which means that my phone charges via USB at the same amperage/voltage/mAh as it would when charging via a wall outlet. I suspect this feature may be part of the problem, so I\u0027ve disabled it.\n\n"

      "content": "If a cable burned-out you would know about it! It would get hot, melt and smell! USB ports are current limited, so this should never happen.\n\nMany USB ports are fitted with a self-healing fuse. If you take too much current from the USB port, then the fuse will \u0027break\u0027 and the USB port will no longer supply current. Often one fuse is shared between 2 or more USB ports. If you remove the cable (stop taking excessive current), the fuse will \u0027heal\u0027 and after 5 - 30 minutes, it will be at it\u0027s normal low resistance again and will be fully \u0027healed\u0027.\n\nMaybe this is what is happening?\n\n"
