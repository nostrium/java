      "content": "The BIOS update for a Toshiba Satellite laptop is [here](http://cdgenp01.csd.toshiba.com/content/support/downloads/skvuv500.exe \"External link\").\n\nWhen you run Launcher, it will create an ISO which is MBR and (I think) UEFI-bootable.\n\nI am trying to extract the FAT16 image which seems to be inside the \u0027boot\u0027 section of the ISO, but am unable to do it. I want to make a UEFI FAT32 image to add to Easy2Boot.\n\nIf you boot the ISO using Easy2Boot in MBR mode, it boots to DOS and you can see an EFI\\\\BOOT folder with .EFI boot files and there are .EFI files present in the root. So it looks like it does contain UEFI boot files.\n\nAny ideas how to extract these files from the ISO? I have tried various utilities and nothing seems to work!\n\nThanks,\n\nSteve\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n"
