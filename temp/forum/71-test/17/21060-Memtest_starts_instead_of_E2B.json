      "content": "Hi. Relatively newbie here. I have created a boot disk with Toshiba Transmemory MX USB flash and it boots OK from 2 of my computers at home but I have a PC that is used as a media server and the USB goes straight to memtest with no other options. Is there a reason this may be happening on one computer? The media server has MSI motherboard.\n\nThanks\n\n"
