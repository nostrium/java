I got an unexpected BSOD shortly into the boot phase, something related to ACPI and needing to press a Function key. It also mentioned changing ACPI settings in the BIOS, which aren\u0027t present in my BIOS. I have also tried turning on CSM/legacy mode. I also get an identical error when trying to boot Hirens Boot CD.\n\nWhat can be done about this and what might the cause be (other than booting on different hardware)?\n\n"

There is nothing contradictory about my statements.\n\nI \\*SAID\\* that \"I recently tried to boot a friend\u0027s genuine XP SP3 (original, not burned) disc on my ASUS Zenbook UX305CA\" with \\*HIS\\* external disc drive. I dont see him often, and the disc drive isnt mine, I cant just use his property whenever I want. The disc appeared to be XP3 SP3 Pro VL, either direct from MSDN or from some other authorized source.He worked for several tech companies back in the early 2000s, so it is safe to assume that he had access to original Windows install discs. I took the liberty of ripping an ISO while he was around, with permission. Which is how I\u0027m now able to attempt to boot its\u0027 contents from USB, or from a burned disc if I had an external disc drive. Hirens is essentially a modded version of XP, it gives the same BSOD no matter how I try to boot it.\n\nI am requesting that you no longer post in my thread, your input is neither needed nor wanted. You make too many unnecessary and untrue assumptions based on what you would like to believe is true, rather than my actual statements, making yourself look like an idiot in the process of doing so. I mean, what kind of dumbass asks a question like \"What is the highest spec BIOS notebook (no UEFI)?\". Think about your own post and maybe you\u0027ll realize why it sounds ridiculous, and why I wouldnt waste my time responding.\n\n"
