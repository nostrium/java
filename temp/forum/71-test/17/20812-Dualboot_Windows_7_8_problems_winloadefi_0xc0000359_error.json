I have unallocated space ready in my second partition to install windows 7 in it. The disk is GPT. I have been trying to make UEFI Bootable (GPT) usb sticks using rufus that i can then use to install my windows7 BUT every time i get stuck in this problem and i don\u0027t understand how the solution works. task sequence with 64 bit boot image? etc.\n\nmy motherboard is asus z97 gamer pro. There are bunch of uefi/cms/secure boot options currently uefi is enabled. I am pretty new to this stuff and my goal is to dualboot windows 7 and 8 64bit both inside 1 ssd into different partitions. Would cleaning all and installing win7 first solve it?\n\n"
