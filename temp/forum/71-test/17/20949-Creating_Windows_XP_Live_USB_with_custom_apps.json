      "content": "Hello. I\u0027m trying to create a Live USB of Windows XP with some custom apps on it, like HD Tune and such, for servicing PCs and laptops. It\u0027d be run off a UFD, along with other stuff, like MemTest86+ and some antivirus boot ISOs. Everything is already hooked up in Grub4DOS, everything runs fine, I just need the WinXP live cd for it to be ready.\n\nCould anybody help me with that? I\u0027d like to make it just like Hiren\u0027s Boot CD but a bit smaller and custom, and what\u0027s the most important, in my own language. I have already seen threads about that, but every single one told to use BartPE, which doesn\u0027t really solve my problem, as I need to install my own applications into it.\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nSpaps\n\n"
