It\u0027s a automatic feautre. Can you use this?  \n\nClarify your needs:  \nIf you like to use original windows install isos without any modifications, then use the original isos as intented by the manufacturer:  \nwrite a DVD, boot from USB DVD drive.  \n\nThis can be a virtual USB DVD drive too. This mounts the ISO file to a DVD drive.  \n[http://www.zalman.co...iew.html?no\u003d161](http://www.zalman.com/contents/products/view.html?no\u003d161 \"External link\")   \n"

Although yumi extracts the iso content. it emulates it like it was burned into DVD\n\ntried www.rmprepusb.com/tutorials/winiso as Wonko the Sane wrote but unfortunately it didn\u0027t work for me for 6 iso\u0027s (3 different languages both 32 and 64 bit)\n\nany other ideas please?\n\nthanks alot\n\n**Edited by frescue, 26 July 2016 - 07:53 AM.**\n"
