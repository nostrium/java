Then I replaced the install.wim from 10 with my AIO install.wim.\n\nIt is working but for some reason, after setup completes, it updates the BCD boot entry of the installed OS on my USB drive (setup drive) and not C:\\\\ drive which is windows. If I take out the USB drive it will not boot windows.\n\nAFAIK, a AIO disk of 7 and 8 using Winpe 8.1 (5.1) is working properly. 10 doesn\u0027t.\n\nAny insight on this? I know I am doing it wrong and need to be pointed in the right direction.\n\nThank you.\n\n"

It was super easy. After I had the ISO, I simply copied the entire contents to a USB that I already had prepared with Rufus using the uefi:ntfs format method with the \"MBR parition scheme for BIOS or UEFI\" partition scheme option.\n\u003e\n\u003e I created an install.wim with 8 versions of 32bit windows and placed it in the x86\\\\sources\\\\ folder and created another install.wim for the 64bit windows versions and placed that in the x64\\\\sources\\\\ folder. I was then able to boot the USB on native UEFI 32bit PC\u0027s (like the intel compute stick), native UEFI 64bit PC\u0027s, and 32 and 64 bit legacy/BIOS systems and it worked perfectly.\n\nOther method with advantage that you can specify in WinNTSetup your Boot and System drive for Install of Windows 10:\n\nAfter booting with Win10PE from USB prepared by Rufus with uefi:ntfs format and using UEFI_MULTI.exe to add boot.wim file\n\nthen use WinNTSetup_x64.exe, which can use your ISO file (also with size above 4 GB) as copied direct to USB without extracting files.\n\n[http://reboot.pro/to...ve/#entry168079](http://reboot.pro/topic/18182-uefi-multi-make-multi-boot-usb-drive/#entry168079 \"\")\n\n[http://www.msfn.org/...nntsetup-v3855/](http://www.msfn.org/board/topic/149612-winntsetup-v3855/ \"External link\")\n\n"
