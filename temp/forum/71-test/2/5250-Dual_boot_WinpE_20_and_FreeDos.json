      "content": "Nuno - Thanks for your quick response to my e-mail.  \n\nI am able to switch between FreeDOS and WinPE now without grub4dos.   \n\nMy machine hard disk is loaded with both WinPE and FreeDOS  \n1) Captured primary partition (C:) boot sector to and kept at C:\\\\BOOTSECT.DOS  \n2) then modified the bootsector C:\\\\bootsect.exe /nt60 C: /Force (this is for WinPE)  \n3) Copied all the required files BCD, boot.ini, NTLDR etc... to C drive   \n4) Modified BCD file such that boot menu gives option for both WinPE after reboot  \n\nNow I am able to switch between FREEDOS and WinPE based on boot menu selection :-)   \n\nHowever my next thing is boot from USB instead of Hard disk i.e USB will have files required for both FreeDOS and WinPE  \n\nTo implement this ,First USB should be bootable on FAT32 with FreeDOS. I am able make USB bootable with FAT16 only having FreeDOS in it but I need to boot from FAT32. Can some one guide me on how to boot FAT32 with FreeDOS in it.  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nThanks  \nAryan   \n"

      "content": "Booting FreeDOS on USB FAT32 can in some cases be tricky.  \n\nThe actual reason is yet not clearly found.  \n\nThrough grub4dos (installing the grldr.mbr) there should be better chances (search on the board, there is a report by **ktp** about FAT32 booting problems solved), but since you seem to not want using it, you can try using makebootfat.  \n\nRead this thread **and** links therein:  \n[http://www.boot-land...?showtopic\u003d5206](http://www.boot-land.net/forums/?showtopic\u003d5206 \"External link\")  \n\njaclaz   \n"
