      "content": "I have lately spent alot of time on trying to get my 1GB Flash bootable with a WinXP style bootmenu.  \n\nI have learnt a couple of things.  \n\n1.) Yes it is possible on both USB Flash and USB HDD  \n2.) Fat16, Fat32 and NTFS works (DOS is not supported by NTFS)  \n3.) You must have A DEVICE (CDROM or HDD) connected to the SATA or IDE port of your PC  \n(Nothing is loaded from here but without it you get a BSOD error - inaccessible boot device)  \n4.) Once created the bootdisk cannot simply be cloned to another (Nice unintended copy protection feature).  \n\nI would like to compare notes with anybody who has done something similar.   \n"

I wanted to keep it plain and stick to what we have, so I used the NT-style boot menu on my USB Flash device.  \n\nIt is currently bootable into a Dos boot menu (Win98 command prompt with Config.sys -Autoexec.bat menu system) and two versions of the same WinPE build (One with the normal set of Disk controler devices and one with an extended set including some SCSI and RAID controlers).  \n\nWhile doing this i noticed the issues stated in post #1. i just wanted to know if anyone else attempted the same and if they noted the same issues.  \n\n:smile:   \n"
