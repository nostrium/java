      "content": "Hello,  \n\nI was reading this post [Multi Multi Multi Boot](http://www.boot-land.net/forums/?showtopic\u003d5434 \"External link\") which has lead me in the right direction. However it still gives me problems.  \n\nWhat I am looking to do it boot multiple ISO images stored on my USB Flash Drive. I have grub4dos installed and working (I get my boot menu and reboot / halt work fine) but I can not get any additional images to boot. Here is my current menu list which is stripped down to only the needed information:  \n\n```\ncolor black/cyan yellow/cyan\n\ntimeout 30\n\ndefault /default\n\n\n\ntitle Ultimate Boot CD\n\nfind --set-root /images/ultimatebootcd/ubcd411.iso\n\nmap /images/ultimatebootcd/ubcd411.iso \u0026#40;hd32\u0026#41;\n\nmap --hook\n\nroot \u0026#40;hd32\u0026#41;\n\nchainloader \u0026#40;hd32\u0026#41;\n\n\n\ntitle BT3 Graphics mode \u0026#40;KDE\u0026#41;\n\nroot \u0026#40;sd1,1\u0026#41;\n\nkernel\u003d /images/backtrack3/boot/vmlinuz ramdisk_size\u003d6666 root\u003d/dev/ram0 rw autoexec\u003dxconf;kdm APPEND vga\u003d0x317\n\ninitrd\u003d/images/backtrack3/boot/initrd.gz\n\nboot\n\n\n\ntitle Reboot\n\nsavedefault --wait\u003d2\n\nreboot\n\n\n\ntitle Halt\n\nsavedefault --wait\u003d2\n\nhalt\n```\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nWhen I boot into \"Ultimate Boot CD\" it seems to hang because of the boot loader inside the ISO image. Never giving an error just flashing the cursor  \n\nNow when I boot into \"BT3 Graphics mode (KDE)\" it tells me:  \n\n```\nroot \u0026#40;hd0,1\u0026#41;\n\n\n\nError 22\u0026#58; No such partition\n\n\n\nPress any key to continue...\n```\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nI can only assume this is because the (hd0,1) it referencing a physical hard drive not the USB drive. In my linux box it shows my drive as sdb with the partition being sdb1  \n\nNow thinking it would be (sd1,1) it came up with a different error:  \n\n```\nroot \u0026#40;sd1,1\u0026#41;\n\n\n\nError 23\u0026#58; Error while parsing number\n\n\n\nPress any key to continue...\n```\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nI have many ISO images I would like to make into a usb multi-tool of software. I would also like to keep it as clean as possible as far as the directory structure. Here is what I would like to have in the end:  \n\n/  \n/documents  \n/downloads  \n/images  \n/logs  \ngrldr  \nmenu.lst  \n\nWith the ISO images stored under /images - This would make it easy for me to update images as time goes on - simply edit the menu list and copy the iso to the drive.  \n\nAny and all help is greatly appreciated, suggestions on better ways are also welcome - Thanks   \n"

However it still gives me problems.  \n\nWhat I am looking to do it boot multiple ISO images stored on my USB Flash Drive. I have grub4dos installed and working (I get my boot menu and reboot / halt work fine) but I can not get any additional images to boot. Here is my current menu list which is stripped down to only the needed information:  \n\n```\ncolor black/cyan yellow/cyan\n\ntimeout 30\n\ndefault /default\n\n\n\ntitle Ultimate Boot CD\n\nfind --set-root /images/ultimatebootcd/ubcd411.iso\n\nmap /images/ultimatebootcd/ubcd411.iso \u0026#40;hd32\u0026#41;\n\nmap --hook\n\nroot \u0026#40;hd32\u0026#41;\n\nchainloader \u0026#40;hd32\u0026#41;\n\n\n\ntitle BT3 Graphics mode \u0026#40;KDE\u0026#41;\n\nroot \u0026#40;sd1,1\u0026#41;\n\nkernel\u003d /images/backtrack3/boot/vmlinuz ramdisk_size\u003d6666 root\u003d/dev/ram0 rw autoexec\u003dxconf;kdm APPEND vga\u003d0x317\n\ninitrd\u003d/images/backtrack3/boot/initrd.gz\n\nboot\n\n\n\ntitle Reboot\n\nsavedefault --wait\u003d2\n\nreboot\n\n\n\ntitle Halt\n\nsavedefault --wait\u003d2\n\nhalt\n```\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nWhen I boot into \"Ultimate Boot CD\" it seems to hang because of the boot loader inside the ISO image. Never giving an error just flashing the cursor  \n\nNow when I boot into \"BT3 Graphics mode (KDE)\" it tells me:  \n\n```\nroot \u0026#40;hd0,1\u0026#41;\n\n\n\nError 22\u0026#58; No such partition\n\n\n\nPress any key to continue...\n```\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nI can only assume this is because the (hd0,1) it referencing a physical hard drive not the USB drive. In my linux box it shows my drive as sdb with the partition being sdb1  \n\nNow thinking it would be (sd1,1) it came up with a different error:  \n\n```\nroot \u0026#40;sd1,1\u0026#41;\n\n\n\nError 23\u0026#58; Error while parsing number\n\n\n\nPress any key to continue...\n```\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nI have many ISO images I would like to make into a usb multi-tool of software. I would also like to keep it as clean as possible as far as the directory structure. Here is what I would like to have in the end:  \n\n/  \n/documents  \n/downloads  \n/images  \n/logs  \ngrldr  \nmenu.lst  \n\nWith the ISO images stored under /images - This would make it easy for me to update images as time goes on - simply edit the menu list and copy the iso to the drive.  \n\nAny and all help is greatly appreciated, suggestions on better ways are also welcome - Thanks   \n"
