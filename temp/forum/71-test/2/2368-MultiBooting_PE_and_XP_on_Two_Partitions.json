Your question is not clear!!  \nBut ,If you mean to have windows XP in one partition,and a bootable image in other partition  \nso that bootable image can do the ghost action,and can restor or take image of your XP partition,  \nyou can do as below:  \n\n1. Install XP in second partition.  \n2. Download Aero Studio 2007,make abootable iso by that and put ghost 11 files on it,then use the  \nAvlgomgr in aero studio to run that image from first partition.  \n3. Know if you can work succesfuly you will have two options in your boot.ini: loading XP or loading   \nimage you have made.  \n4.aero studio can run bootable images (ofcourse not all images for example setupldr.bin),now you will   \nbe able to boot by aero iso,use ghost32 v11(or other program) to take image of your XP partition,  \nand save the image in 1st partition (if you just have two partitions),and when needed you can restore  \nin the same manner.  \n\nhope this will help,for using aero studio,i havewritten a small tutorial,in tutorial section of site  \nhave fun  \nshirin   \n"
