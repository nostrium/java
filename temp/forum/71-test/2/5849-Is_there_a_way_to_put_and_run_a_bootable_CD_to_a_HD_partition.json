      "content": "This depends entirely on the OS under which your boot disk is running.  \n\nLinux based LiveCD\u0027s seem to run very well directly as ISO image, look for grub on this forum as the links that Jaclaz mentioned earlier.  \n\nIf it\u0027s windows XP PE based - you will need to adapt your build to run from HDD or use the RAM files from windows 2003 to create a SDI compatible image.  \n\nThe informations for doing this sort of step is also mentioned on this forum - using the search tool should bring up a lot of relevant informations.  \n\nIf you use the LiveXP project (Windows XP PE from LiveCD using winbuilder) then you find a script that will do all these steps for you to prepare the image to load into memory and be started as a single image.  \n\nThis involves reading a bit to understand how they work.  \n\nLook on the tutorials section of this forum for more informations.  \n\n![:huh:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/huh.png)   \n"

      "content": "okay, I would like to learn if there is a certain way of doing this but I understand from you answer that there is no one way.  \n\nlet me ask and request help in more spesific example then. I am using PLoP Boot Manager (I hope it is legal ![:huh:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/huh.png)) in a bootabe CD (I downloaded from [http://www.plop.at/e...managerdl.html)](http://www.plop.at/en/bootmanagerdl.html) \"External link\")  \n\nThere is harddisk install version of the program but it writes on MBR so I don\u0027t want to use that version. I want my MBR stay untouched.   \n\nSo, I created a new partition at the end ofmy harddisk and I only want to install CD version of this boot manager to thi very small partition on my HD. And then I will add this partition as a choice of boot, to Acronis OS selector menu.  \n\nCan you help me by giving information with some specific steps, what should I do first?   \n"
