Then run the tool and point it to the various sources. On one go you can prepare Vista setup, XP setup, BartPE and if you need SysLinix bootsector and boot files, if needed to launch the Linux distro you have. Another option is to add an entry in grub4dos menu.lst for that distro. On second run prepare VistaPE in another partition.  \n\nWhat is Linux Divers OS, a distribution named this?   \n"

      "content": "Sorry, delayed answer.  \n\nThere is not \"universal\" way to put Linux on USB. It depends on the Linux distribution, but in general it\u0027s easy and doable, especially if the distro has live USB version.  \nYou may either use the generated menu.lst in root and add grub4dos menus for your distro, or you can install SysLinux bootsector, and play with it\u0027s configuration file eventually. Generally most USB-ready distros use syslinux as boot loader. So it\u0027s simply matter of coping the contents onto the USB stick.  \nWinSetupFromUSB makes syslinux bootsector and copies LDLINUX.SYS (the syslinux loader) to root if no folder is specified to be copied.  \nSince LDLINUX will seek for SYSLINUX folder to find it\u0027s configuration file, when you copy the distro in question you will already have that SYSLINUX folder ready.  \nI can help you further if you say which distro have in mind.   \n"
