As an aside, this is also how I boot LiveXP images etc, but this image creation is now automated via a modified version of BootSDI for my own use.)  \n\n2. Copy the following files from server 2003 to the image using UltraISO: ntdetect.com and setupldr.bin renamed ntldr.  \n\n3. Copy erd.iso to the the image using UltraISO.  \n\n4. Copy winnt.sif to the image using UltraISO. winnt.sif should have the following lines:  \n\n```\n\u0026#91;SetupData\u0026#93; \n\nBootDevice \u003d \u0026#34;ramdisk\u0026#40;0\u0026#41;\u0026#34; \n\nBootPath \u003d \u0026#34;\\I386\\SYSTEM32\\\u0026#34; \n\nOsLoadOptions \u003d \u0026#34;/noguiboot /fastdetect /minint /rdexportascd /rdpath\u003derd.iso\u0026#34;\n```\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n5.

As said this can be done with grub4dos.  \n\nIt is possible to use grldr as the first stage loader, i.e. have syslinux load a bootsector that invokes grldr, which then chainloads directly the loader in \\\\ERDC\\\\, but still grldr (and a menu.lst) needs to be on root.  \n\nAt this point it is maybe straighter to put aside syslinux and use directly grub4dos for all booting chores.  \n\nAlternatively you can make a grub4dos bootfloppy image, that can be zipped and put wherever you want, and booted through syslinux/memdisk:  \n1st solution:  \nSyslinux -\\\u003e bootsect.bss -\\\u003e loader in ROOT  \n\n2nd solution:  \nSyslinux -\\\u003e bootsect.bss -\\\u003e grldr in ROOT -\\\u003e menu.lst in ROOT -\\\u003e loader in \\\\ERDC\\\\  \n\n3rd solution:  \ngrldr in ROOT -\\\u003e menu.lst in ROOT -\\\u003e loader in \\\\ERDC\\\\ (and all other boot items - NO syslinux/memdisk)  \n\n4th solution:  \nSyslinux -\\\u003e memdisk -\\\u003e grub4dos floppy image zipped anywhere on drive -\\\u003e loader in \\\\ERDC\\\\  \n\njaclaz   \n"

Mounting the image in windows and formatting results in a non-booting image.  \n\nI have also found that I have to generate the bootinfotable with UltraISO to get a booting image.  \n\nI have found, too, since posting the image that files need not be copied with UltraISO, but that the image may be mounted with vdk and copied in a regular manner, so that\u0027s good.  \n\nIs there a way around the qemu/freedos stage to still have a bootable image with syslinux and avlgomgr?  \n\nRegards,  \nGalapo.   \n"

Freedos doesn\u0027t have ntfs last time I checked.\nYes, correct.  \n\n\u003e I have found that I have to partition and format with freedos otherwise the image cannot be booted with syslinux or avlgomgr.\nYes, I see, the point is whether it is the MBR or the bootsector (or both) that make it \"compatible\".  \nMy ***guess*** is that it is either just the MBR, that on first look appears to be much less \"picky\" than the 2K/XP one, as it makes a lot less checks, or, more simply:  \n\u003e Mounting the image in windows and formatting results in a non-booting image.\nHere (again my ***guess*** ) this could be due to a \"non-proper\" (no offence intended ![:loleverybody:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/loleverybody.gif)) way of fdisking/formatting it under 2K/XP.  \n\nIf you are into a bit of experimenting, I think I can give you some instructions to replicate the thing without using QEMU. (provided that my guess is correct, of course).  \n\nPlease bear with me, you will need some time and patience.  \n(actually ***plenty*** of both ![:w00t:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/w00t.gif) )  \n\nEach step is essential and should be carried on exactly as described.  \n\nLet\u0027s try to replicate your ERD.IMG, by creating a brand new ERD1.IMG:  \n\n1) To save space, we better use a NTFS partition to host the file; for the sake of this, I will use my W:\\\\ drive, change letter to adapt to your setup.  \n2) Get mksparse:  \n[http://www.acc.umu.se/\\~bosse/](http://www.acc.umu.se/~bosse/ \"External link\")  \n[http://www.acc.umu.s...se/mksparse.zip](http://www.acc.umu.se/~bosse/mksparse.zip \"External link\")  \nand create a 152 Megabyte file:  \n\n```\nmksparse W\u0026#58;\\ERD1.img 152M\n```\n\n3) Now create a W:\\\\ERD1.PLN file with Notepad:  \n\u003e DRIVETYPE ide  \n\u003e CYLINDERS 307  \n\u003e HEADS 16  \n\u003e SECTORS 63  \n\u003e ACCESS \"W:\\\\ERD1.IMG\" 0 311296\n(simply copy and paste the above, edit drive letter or path as needed)   \n4) Mount with VDK the ERD1.PLN file, **NOT** the ERD1.IMG one.   \nVDK, being the file all 00\u0027s will NOT find any partition on it, nor it will assign any letter to the drive.  \n5) Now mount also your previous ERD.IMG with VDK  \n6) Get Beeblebrox:  \n[http://students.cs.byu.edu/\\~codyb/](http://students.cs.byu.edu/~codyb/ \"External link\")  \nand run it.  \nYou will see that you have, ADDITIONALLY to your \"real\" PHYSICALDRIVE(s) another 4 of them, if you have 1 Hard disk on your machine, ERD1.IMG will be PHYSICALDRIVE1 and ERD.IMG will be PHYSICALDRIVE2, if you have two hard disks, ERD1.IMG will be PHYSICALDRIVE2 and ERD.IMG will be PHYSICALDRIVE3, and so on.  \nIf you open the PHYSICALDRIVE corresponding to ERD1.IMG, you will see all blank fields, whilst if you open the one corresponding to ERD.IMG you will see these values:  \n\u003e 06-80-0-1-1-307-15-63-63-310401\nNOW, access the PHYSICALDRIVE corresponding to ERD1.IMG and copy to it the same values.  \n7) Now get MBRFIX:  \n[http://www.sysint.no...ting/MbrFix.htm](http://www.sysint.no/Nedlasting/MbrFix.htm \"External link\")  \n[http://www.sysint.no...ting/MbrFix.zip](http://www.sysint.no/Nedlasting/MbrFix.zip \"External link\")  \nand use it to copy the MBR from the PHYSICALDRIVE corresponding to ERD.IMG to a file, let\u0027s say W:\\\\ERDMBR.MBR.  \nNot a self promotion, mind you ![:w00t:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/w00t.gif), but if you use my small pseudo-GUI\u0027s for both VDK and MBRFIX, the procedure might be easier to be carried on:  \n[http://home.graffiti...z:graffiti.net/](http://home.graffiti.net/jaclaz:graffiti.net/ \"External link\")  \n[http://home.graffiti...ts/VDM/vdm.html](http://home.graffiti.net/jaclaz:graffiti.n...ts/VDM/vdm.html \"External link\")  \nNow, use MBRFIX to copy to the PHYSICALDRIVE corresponding to ERD1.IMG the \"normal\" 2K/XP MBR.  \n8)Now unmount both images from VDK and re-mount just ERD1.PLN.  \nThis time a drive letter will be assigned to the partition.  \n9) Double click on the corresponding drive letter in Explorer, and it will prompt you with \"Volume not formatted, do you want to format it?\" or something like it. Click OK, check that FAT is selected and go on.  \n\nNow you have a ERD1.IMG that is identical to ERD.IMG but for TWO things:  \n1) The MBR code is the 2K/XP/2003  \n2) The bootsector has been generated by your version of FORMAT (i.e. if you use a non-english version of 2K/XP, error messages will be in your language)  \n\nTry if this image works as the old one. (it should) ![:w00t:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/w00t.gif)  \n\nIf it does not, mount it in VDK, and use MBRFIX to restore to the image the FREE FDISK MBR (which you previously saved as W:\\\\ERDMBR.MBR.  \n\nTry it again, if this time it does work, it means that it\u0027s the FREE FDISK MBR code that makes the difference, if it does not, it means that there is something else. ![:w00t:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/w00t.gif) ![:w00t:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/w00t.gif)   \n\nPlease do report what happens, then we will be able to discuss the meaningful parts of the procedure I suggested and made you for the moment \"blindly\" trust. ![:w00t:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/w00t.gif)   \n\njaclaz   \n"
