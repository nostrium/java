      "content": "I have a multiboot (XP and LiveXP) project, that boots with BCDW. I would like to use CDShell, due to its more graphical nature. The problem i have, is cdshell has a folder named boot, and livexp (created with UXP) has a file called boot. Any suggestions on a way around this, or maybe a different graphical boot option i havent found yet?  \nthanks in advance....   \n"

      "content": "\"boot\" is a tag reference that you find inside the txtsetup.sif from LiveXP.  \n\nAfter creating a liveXP - find it\u0027s txtsetup.sif and look for this reference - you can change to whatever else you prefer.  \n\nBCDW is good because it allows to use several XP PE boot disks without need for hex edits for I wouldn\u0027t mind adding support for other boot managers if you show me how they work.  \n\n![:lol:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/laugh.png)   \n"
