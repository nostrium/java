      "content": "I always find GPT to be a \"real pain in ...\". Never I have been able to successfully dual boot Windows 8.x with Ubuntu under GPT/UEFI configuration. Newer versions of Ubuntu (12.04 rev 2 onwards, if I can remember correctly) are said to support *SecureBoot* . But, with both *SecureBoot* turned ON/OFF, dual boot doesn\u0027t work. Mostly laptops ships with UEFI/GPT and Windows 8.x installed. If you install Ubuntu under this configuration, it\u0027ll install successfully. But, the post-installation reboot will straight boot the laptop into Windows 8. Ubuntu\u0027s built-in partition manager does not allow to revert the layout back to MBR. I used GParted Live image to wipe out GPT, initialize an MBR table and re-partitioned it with Legacy/BIOS mode turned on. I am keen to listen to a success story of dual booting Windows 8.x with Ubuntu under GPT/UEFI configuration.\n\n"

It remains to see.\n\nI have a dual boot system with Windows 7 and Ubuntu 14.04. For Linux, you don\u0027t need separate partition for all. Unlike Windows, Linux file system transparently spans across volumes, but giving an illusion of unified file system rooted at / (ROOT DIR). Even if you don\u0027t allocate separate logical volumes a.k.a. partitions for /home, /boot, root directory (/), they all will happily reside under the same partition, co-existing as directories. Only partition you may prefer to allocate separately is swap/virtual memory secondary storage which is as much like Windows pagefile.\n\n"
