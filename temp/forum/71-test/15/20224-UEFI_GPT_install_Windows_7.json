      "content": "Greetings folks.\n\nLong post so feel free to skip the intro if you don\u0027t have much time to read.\n\n## intro ##\n\nLet me make a small introduction on why/what I am posting here.\n\nMy boss just bought me a new laptop that comes with Windows 8.1. It\u0027s an Asus X552 which means that unfortunately it\u0027s not a business laptop as it was supposed to be. Blame the damned crisis...\n\nProblem is, most of the software that I will be running on it still ++doesn\u0027t run on Windows 8.1++ which means that ++I need to reinstall windows 7++ 64bits on it.\n\nSince the hdd has little space for my needs, the laptop doesn\u0027t come with a dvd reader. Instead it comes with another hdd with a dvd-to-hdd adapter.\n\nThis means I need to reinstall using windows 7 USB boot disk because I\u0027m not very familiar with PXE :wink:.\n\n## end of intro ##\n\nProblem is, this is my first time with UEFI. I was able to create a windows 7 boot disk using [Rufus](http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/15458-uefi-bootable-usb-flash-drive-create-windows.html \"External link\") but then, when Windows is supposed to start copying files to disk, it seems it doesn\u0027t recognize my hdd. I know that this may sound a bit vague. If you need the specific error message let me know and I\u0027ll try to reinstall and grab a screenshot with a camera.\n\nBTW, since it was making some strange/funny noise, I have removed the hdd and the dvd-to-hdd adapter and I returned it as a DoA.\n\nSomeone told me that I could turn the system into a non-UEFI+MBR but I would rather do it properly using UEFI+GPT.\n\nAll help will be greatly appreciated.\n\nCheers\n\n"

      "content": "Maybe it helps to know, how I solved a similar situation with my Lenovo, delivered with Win8.1, booting with UEFI.\n\nIt also has no DVD reader.\n\n* Using Parted Magic, I made the win8 partition smaller and created an additional new one for Win7 x64.\n* I extracted the Win7 CD onto an USB stick (not necessary to have it bootable, no RUFUS etc.).\n* Added a folder \"Lenovo\" to the stick and copied Lenovo drivers into it. That were proprietary drivers not contained in the Win7 setup. Which are needed, could be found only by try and error:\n  * Realtek LAN driver from Lenovo\n  * Intel Wireless from Lenovo\n* Depending on your Hardware you need other/additional drivers, maybe a SATA driver, as Wonko said.\n* Booted from 8.1 and ran setup on the stick, choosing to install into the new partition. When setup needs some drivers I pointed to the prepared folder drivers.\n* In the running win7 I downloaded, installed / ran:\n  * Microsoft .NET installer: [http://download.micr...ull_x86_x64.exe](http://download.microsoft.com/download/9/5/A/95A9616B-7A37-4AF6-BC36-D6EA96C8DAAE/dotNetFx40_Full_x86_x64.exe \"External link\")\n  * Lenovo system updater: [http://download.leno...-09-16-2014.exe](http://download.lenovo.com/pccbbs/thinkvantage_en/systemupdate506-09-16-2014.exe \"External link\")\n\nGood luck!\n\nPeter ![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif)\n\n"

      "content": "@erwan.I\n\nThanks for the tip. I\u0027m gonna try that.\n\n@pscEx\n\nUnfortunately, that\u0027s a bit too late for me.\n\nI no longer have Windows 8.1 installed. During one of my trials I formated the hdd...\n\nI have been using the laptop but running a Lubuntu LiveCD from a usb pendisk. But this setup doesn\u0027t allow me to actually work.\n\nTo me this sounds awful when I say it but I actually need Windows or else I can\u0027t work. ![:(](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/sad.png)\n\nThough when I get home at the end of the day I can enjoy (Arch) Linux :smile:\n\n"
