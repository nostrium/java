      "content": "If you used RMPrepUSB and Boot as HDD (C: 2PTNS) then this creates a 2nd small hidden partition (this type 21h small partition is not used and not needed if you are going to create more partitions). Then if you add a logical partition it will create another partition entry.\n\nUse RMPrepUSB - Drive Info - 0 to see 4 primary partitions. Use Easeus Home Partition Master to erase the ones you don\u0027t want.\n\nYou can have one Primary partition + any number of Logical paritions. In the Partition Table you should see the 1st partition + one Type F extended partition, with ptn 3 and 4 empty.\n\nP.S. Why FAT32 for the E2B partition ?? This will restrict you to \\\u003c4GB .imgPTN files and \\\u003c4GB ISOs?\n\n"

      "content": "If you need FAT32 then there are many ways around it. e.g.\n\n1. Make a .img file which is a disk image formatted as FAT12/FAT16/FAT32 and mount that as a virtual BIOS disk . .e.g. DOS.ima and just copy the file to an E2B menu folder\n\n2. Add an extra FAT32 partition to the E2B USB drive, you can copy files to it and boot to the files from an E2B .mnu file\n\n3. Make an image partition file (.imgPTN) - e.g. if you have a working FAT32 USB flash drive, drag-and-drop the whole drive icon/letter onto the the MakePartImage MPI_FAT32 desktop shortcut to make a FAT32 image partition file and add it to your E2B USB drive - when you run this, it will replace the E2B NTFS partition with a FAT32 partition containing all your FAT32 files.\n\n"
