(and I can rename it back to syslinux_custom.cfg when needed).

Not Grub4dos. But I add grub.exe file to chainload when needed. I use lang.lst to load Dos.img. Of course, syslinux can load dos.img but I\u0027m new with syslinux, so I don\u0027t know which must be type.\n\n```\nlabel Change Language\nmenu label ^L   Change your default language setting\nkernel /syslinux/grub.exe --config-file\u003d\"find --set-root /syslinux/dos.img \u0026\u0026 set dos\u003d/syslinux/dos.img;map --mem %dos% (fd0);map --hook;chainloader (fd0)+1;rootnoverify (fd0);map --floppies\u003d1\"\nMENU IMMEDIATE\n```\n\nIf the line that I type in above is right, It make the line of command look too long.

I don\u0027t boot one to syslinux with syslinux.cfg (Englsih) just only change language to custom language. If I need that, I will make only one syslinux.cfg with my custom language. In my case, I want to create USB boot with syslinux that have 2 language options.  \nOf course I can use\n\n```\nlabel Change Language\nmenu label ^L  Change your default language setting\nkernel /syslinux/menu.c32\nAPPEND /syslinux_custom.cfg\n```\n\nThen we just need choose this lable to change language. But it only change our lang when we choice it. I want to take change forever until we choose Change Language label to back original langugage (In my case is English). To do this, I must rename syslinux.cfg to syslinux.org and rename syslinux_custom.cfg (with custom language) to syslinux.cfg to syslinux config it by default.

Copy mylinux1.cfg contents to Syslinux.cfg (or \"Change language to English\")\n2.

And with dd command, I have 3 .cfg file which have quite many label.

(Or I must type very very many white spaces)  \nSo in my case, maybe I should choose dd command instead cat command. With many label, size of syslinux.cfg, mylinux1.cfg, mylinux2.cfg always \"big\" NTFS files. I don\u0027t want to add many lines to syslinux.cfg which not necessary just to make it\u0027s size bigger.  \nAnw, Thanks for your help **Wonko** and **Steve6375**.\n\nAnd I\u0027m a newbie with DOS, grub4dos and syslinux commands and with my poor English, so surely, you got many trouble to help me.
