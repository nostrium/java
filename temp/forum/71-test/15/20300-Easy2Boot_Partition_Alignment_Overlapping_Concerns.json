      "content": "I used a combination of two different tutorials to build a Windows To Go 8.1 on \u0027Removable\u0027 Easy2Boot Drive.  \nI started out with (in normal mode):  \nPTN1 FAT32 \u003d 5 GB  \nPTN2 NTFS \u003d 30 GB  \n\nBooted to CSM mode a couple times to check out.  \nDecided to resize partitions because couldn\u0027t figure out why PTN1 (normal mode) needed to be 5 GB.  \n\nSwitched back to normal mode \\\u003e first HDD \\\u003e resized partitions:  \nPTN1 FAT32 \u003d 300 MB - - - (an \u0027MS System\u0027 partition for boot managers \u0027 loaders)  \nPTN2 NTFS \u003d 60 GB - - - (for Easy2Boot \\\u0026 payload files, becomes PTN1 in CSM mode)  \nDid not create PTN3 or PTN4 since directed to leave those entries blank for Linux ISOs.  \n\nAnyway, so now, when in CSM mode, it still shows (similar to the normal mode that I first booted to):  \nUnallocated \u003d \\~5 GB **(rather than 300 MB)**   \nPTN1 NTFS \u003d \\~30 GB **(rather than 60 GB)**   \n\nThis makes for some serious partition overlapping between CSM mode and normal mode.  \nThus my concern that some sectors will be overwritten between modes.  \nIs there a way to accurately realign partitions between modes?  \nI\u0027m guessing that Easy2Boot adopted this CSM mode partition layout (from normal mode) when it was first booted to CSM mode? And then just kept it that way.  \n\nThanks  \n\n"

This can hold a .imgPTN file which should be a NTFS-formatted partition image (made using the MakePartImage desktop shortcut and specify it\u0027s size manually).\n\nSelect the .imgPTN file in the E2B menu and run it so that you get to CSM mode and the CSM menu.\n\nPtn1 will now be the size of your .imgPTN file and can contain your \\\\boot folder, \\\\bootmgr and your .vhd file.\n\nThe other alternative is to not use a .imgPTN file at all. Just add the \\\\boot folder, \\\\bootmgr file and .vhd file to the root of your E2B NTFS drive and add a .mnu file which will boot to \\\\bootmgr straight from the E2B partition.\n\n**Edited by steve6375, 29 January 2015 - 10:57 AM.**\n"

And then Easy2Boot would have defined the space where PTN1 was as 7+ GB to account for the loaded .imgPTN file\u0027s new position.\n\u003e The start and size of the partition in CSM mode is the start of the .imgPTN file (wherever it happens to be on the drive) and the size of the .imgPTN file (i.e. the file size).\n\nTHANKS  \n\n**Edited by Noer5, 30 January 2015 - 12:12 PM.**\n"
