      "content": "So, I created an E2B flash drive and copied over ISO files for Server 2012, Server 2012 R2, and Win 8.1. I tested it on a Dell laptop and it all worked perfectly fine.\n\nI then tried to use it on a Dell R630 server and didn\u0027t have any luck. I get the menu, I make my choice, it shows the initial Windows loading screen with the DOS style bar that goes across the bottom, and then I get an error.\n\nWindows fails to start.\n\nFile: \\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\boot\\\\winload.exe\n\nStatus: 0xc0000001\n\nInfo: The application or operating system couldn\u0027t be loaded because a required file is missing or contains errors.\n\nThe server is brand new, just out of the box. I checked and it is not using UEFI mode.\n\nI took the same flash drive back to a different Dell Laptop and tried again and it loaded up and installed just fine.\n\nI tried all of the ISOs that I have and they all do the same thing.\n\nAnyone run into this and hopefully know a fix? :smile:\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n"

Although the machines support normal BIOS, they cannot install xp.\nat what point of install? wow that is starnge, I wonder what it could be?  \n\nmy older Dell laptop has a peculiar BIOS. lots of strange behavior when booting various USB. eg. some USB wont boot unless there is a HDD present, others will boot without HDD present.  \n\nsome will boot with only a certain HDD present but not other HDD.  \n\nthats just what I recall but that dell has caused me all kinds of wasted time trying experimental boot senarios   \n"

      "content": "OK, so we figured it out. ARGH! Turns out when the RAID was setup, the Virtual Drives didn\u0027t Initialize so they were in some funky state. I tried using our normal image and that didn\u0027t work either which led me to the solution.\n\nI just reinitialized the drives and tried again and it\u0027s working fine now. \\*sigh\\*\n\nThanks.\n\n"
