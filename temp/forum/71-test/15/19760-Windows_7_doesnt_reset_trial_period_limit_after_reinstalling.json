      "content": "I am reinstalling windows 7 from usb. I have 3 days left from the trial and i have used all extended period of time that is allowed by microsoft. Before reinstalling windows i am running these commands from cmd:  \n\nbootrec /fixmbr  \nbootrec /fixboot  \n\nBut after installing it still shows that i have 3 days left to activate.  \n\nNow, i have done this before and it worked, but i don\u0027t know why now it doesn\u0027t work. I tried two times without success.  \n\nI hope someone can help. I thought windows 7 is storing data for the trial period somewhere in the boot sector and running these two commands deletes all the data, but i guess i am wrong.\n\n"

Activation and licensing info are not stored in boot sector or MBR. You should buy a legal copy and enter the serial key to activate.\n\nBtw, you can legally download and install Enterprise evaluation version of either Windows 7 or 8 and run it for 90 days.\n\n"

      "content": "So, to put it another way - what version are you trying to \"use\" in this manner? Agent47 is right in that only the Enterprise Eval version will run for 90 days without proper activation. The others give you the threee days (as you are seeing).\n\n"
