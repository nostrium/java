      "content": "New here, I had a few isos laying around and I thought I could place them all on a pendrive and be able to boot into them and install whatever I need on a PC that doesn\u0027t have any optical drives on it.\n\nIs it possible to do that from Linux? I don\u0027t have any Windows version installed.\n\nI tried [this guide](http://askubuntu.com/questions/116885/can-i-use-ubuntu-to-write-a-windows-7-iso-to-usb/363630#363630 \"External link\"), but grub wouldn\u0027t install properly on FAT32 here, so it wouldn\u0027t boot. Also tried [this guide](http://xmodulo.com/boot-iso-image-from-grub.html \"External link\"), but for some reason it says \"Cannot find the file specified\" or a similar error during boot when selecting Windows 7 (haven\u0027t tried it with WindowsXP iso yet as I don\u0027t know what arguments to add. After pressing enter, I get kicked back to the grub menu Strangely with the latter method GParted live boots with the specified arguments added to the menuentry, but also get the same error as above, just that when I press enter, it boots into the live session.\n\n**Edited by andoru, 19 December 2014 - 01:02 AM.**\n"

It gets stuck with \"Checking last sector is accessible...\" on screen, not doing anything (I\u0027ve left it on for over an hour).\n\nOn another PC I get this instead: [https://i.imgur.com/x2cK5Qn.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/x2cK5Qn.jpg \"External link\")\n\nOn the E2B site under Troubleshooting says that the former message should only stay on-screen for a few minutes and it usually happens only on NTFS partitions. The weird thing with both of the above is that the partition was formatted as FAT32. Anything to try out to fix this problem before I try a jab at grub4dos?\n\nSo far I tried following [this guide](http://rmprepusb.com/tutorials/114 \"External link\"), and afterwards I just ran the fmt.sh script and copied over the files, but got the same result.\n\n"
