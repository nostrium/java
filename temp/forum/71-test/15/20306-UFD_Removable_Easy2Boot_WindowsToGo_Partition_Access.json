      "content": "Fantastic ! Thanks devdevadev.  \nYour method worked like a charm. Didn\u0027t even have to edit the cfadisk.inf file.  \n\nI was thinking either Karyonix\u0027s Diskmod method or the Hitachi Microdrive cfadisk method.  \nHad read that Karyonix\u0027s Diskmod method was better, but some reported not even being able to boot.  \nSo was leaning toward the Hitachi Microdrive cfadisk method.  \nThanks for confirming that this works on WTG on removable.  \n\nFor others:  \nIn case not obvious, this is done from within WTG on the UFD.  \nStep 4 could be \u003d  \n4. Don\u0027t use windows update. Instead click \"Browse my Computer...\"  \n5. Could eliminate step 5 as it doesn\u0027t do any good to browse to the desktop twice. And could lead to wrong choice.  \n\nThanks again devdevadev !\n\n"
