UFD_FORMAT.exe - Format Stick is used to make USB-Stick with two Partitions  \nSelect USB-Stick as Target Drive and Select 2nd Partition Checkbox  \n3. USB_Part_Flip.exe is used so that (unformatted) 2nd Partition becomes visible in Windows  \n4. Use Windows Format to give 2nd Partition NTFS Format and Label USB_SYS  \n5. Use UEFI_MULTI.exe in Win 7/8 OS to Add VHD Boot Image files to NTFS USB_SYS drive  \nFor UEFI support then Windows 8x64 is needed as operating system  \n6. Copy all files except VHD file to external folder e.g. U_BOOT in folder UFD_FORMAT  \n7. USB_Part_Flip.exe is used so that 1st Partition USB_BOOT becomes visible in Windows  \n8. Copy content of U_BOOT folder (the boot files) to USB_BOOT Drive  \n9. Use UEFI_MULTI.exe to Add WIM or ISO Boot Image files to USB_BOOT drive (USB-Stick)  \n10. Boot from USB-Stick - In Boot Manager menu select boot-WIM or Grub4dos Menu  \nUEFI Secure boot is possible with boot.wim of Windows 8 x64 Recovery Stick  \nIn Grub4dos Menu select Win8 VHD for booting fom RAMDISK  \nIn some cases F12 at the beep reboots UEFI into BIOS mode and allows to select Grub4dos menu  \nOtherwise you have to change settings in UEFI firmware to allow booting in BIOS-mode and to get Grub4dos Menu  \n\n![:cheers:](https://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif)\n\n"

      "content": "I have been using all your software since long time ago, to make 7PE\u0027s, XP and 7 VHD\u0027s and now tried UEFI_MULTI and every one of them works great, THANK YOU! for this fantastic tools.\n\nThis is my Adata 32 GB USB flash disk with two partitions:\n\n**EDIT:** Alternative format procedure used: I just made a multipartition USB stick using RMPrepUSB for the first primary active partition and EasyUS PartitionMaster 10 to make an unformated second primary partition, later using BootIce formated it to exFAT.\n\n1.- First primary partition 1.9 GB FAT32 type 0C active partition; used UEFI_MULTI to copy Win8.1SE_x64 boot.wim file to root, an several other ISO\u0027s to directory Images, and make the boot files and EFI folder also Grub4dos mbr and grldr and make BCD option to boot Grub4dos. + I manually added BootIce, Hitachi Microdrive Filter Driver folder and Karyonix -- diskmod.sys folder (both having x64 versions)\n\n2.- Second primary partition 28 GB exFAT; after make it visible to windows using BootIce, manualy copied Win7 and Win8 install ISO\u0027s, + WinNTSetup (BootIce included in tools folder), Hitachi Microdrive Filter Driver folder and Karyonix -- diskmod.sys folder, then make visible to windows the FAT32 partition.\n\n3.- Boot from USB to Win8.1SE_x64 boot.wim (it was a MBR PC, I don\u0027t have my UEFI win8 laptop with me at the moment), I tried to install diskmod.sys to be able to see the second partition too, a message saying something like \"Windows has the best driver already installed\" and no way to install it, same hapend when tried Hitachi microdriver, so the other alternative I had just in case was BootIce and make the second partition visible to windows, then using WinNTSetup is possible to install 7 or 8.\n\n4.- I reboot again from USB to Win8.1SE_x64 boot.wim this time I let the second partition visible, It booted just fine, so no need to switch back every boot.\n\nWell after this loooong history I would like to suggest:\n\nI) Add to your UFD_FORMAT tool the option to select FAT32 size in MB or GB, now is the remaining from NTFS selection (with new thumb drives sizes 25% for FAT32 to put some WinPE\u0027s may be to much), perhaps remove this option from NTFS and just use the remaining from first partition selection.\n\nII) Add exFAT as an option for the second partition format. Since long time ago XP-SP2 and newer systems are able to read and write in exFAT formated Volumes, I have been using this format for more than a year in all my USB flash disks, and I can tell you it is faster than NTFS, also it\u0027s able to content VHD\u0027s of big size and open them through Grub4Dos, another plus is files don\u0027t get fragmented so easy as in NTFS and finally less wear to your stick.\n\nAlso if you allow me I have a question: Could it be possible to inject a filter driver to Win8.1SE_x64 to make it see both partitions?, it\u0027s not so important but I would like to know.\n\nMy UEFI_MULTI USB stick: [https://www.mediafir...fs585eq7tazlh61](https://www.mediafire.com/?fs585eq7tazlh61 \"External link\")\n\nFilter drivers: [http://www.mediafire..._in_Windows.rar](http://www.mediafire.com/download/csag3vd1p7khrbz/Filter_Drivers_%E2%80%93_Removable_Media_as_Fixed_Disk_in_Windows.rar \"External link\")\n\nBest Regards\n\n**Added** alternative format procedure followed to get partition sizes as required.\n\n**Edited by alacran, 15 May 2014 - 07:47 PM.**\n"

Since long time ago XP-SP2 and newer systems are able to read and write in exFAT formated Volumes, I have been using this format for more than a year in all my USB flash disks, and I can tell you it is faster than NTFS, also it\u0027s able to content VHD\u0027s of big size and open them through Grub4Dos, another plus is files don\u0027t get fragmented so easy as in NTFS and finally less wear to your stick.\n\nAlso if you allow me I have a question: Could it be possible to inject a filter driver to Win8.1SE_x64 to make it see both partitions?, it\u0027s not so important but I would like to know.\n\nMy UEFI_MULTI USB stick: [https://www.mediafir...fs585eq7tazlh61](https://www.mediafire.com/?fs585eq7tazlh61 \"External link\")\n\nFilter drivers: [http://www.mediafire..._in_Windows.rar](http://www.mediafire.com/download/csag3vd1p7khrbz/Filter_Drivers_%E2%80%93_Removable_Media_as_Fixed_Disk_in_Windows.rar \"External link\")\n\nBest Regards\n\n**Added** alternative format procedure followed to get partition sizes as required.\n\n**Edited by alacran, 15 May 2014 - 07:47 PM.**\n"

      "content": "\u003e Hi **alacran,**   \n\u003e\n\u003e Thanks for using UEFI_MULTI and for your kind words about my programs.  \n\u003e\n\u003e UFD_FORMAT will ***only*** format the **1st** partition (preferred is FAT32 for compatibility with booting on UEFI computers).  \n\u003e After using USB_Part_Flip.exe or BootIce Parts Manage (easier) to Set Accessible (the unformatted) 2nd Partition,  \n\u003e then you can use Windows Format and it is free to use any format for 2nd partition e.g. NTFS or exFat  \n\u003e\n\u003e The size of the 1st partition is already limited to about 2 GB when using MAX for 2nd partition size.  \n\u003e\n\u003e After booting with x64 boot.wim of Win8.1SE then it is simply to use BootIce to make 2nd partition of USB-Stick visible,  \n\u003e so that WinNTSetup_x64.exe can be used to select with r-mouse the Win 8.1 ISO file on 2nd partition of USB-Stick.  \n\u003e May be it is possible to use inject filter driver in Win8.1SE, but I have not done this yet, since using BootIce is very simple as described.  \n\u003e\n\u003e ![:cheers:](https://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif)\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n**Hi****\u0027wimb\u0027**   \n\nFirst lots of thanks for both **\u0027UFD FORMAT\u0027** and **\u0027UEFI MULTI\u0027.**..........  \n\nAs you said that **\u0027It is possible to use inject filter driver in Win8.1SE\u0027** . I want to use **Inject Filter Drive** in **\u0027Win8.1SE\u0027** because it will be very easy for me to select Win 8.1 ISO file on **2nd partition** of **\u0027Removable\u0027** USB-Stick.   \nActually I am a **Visually Handicapped Student** and do not want to use**\u0027Bootice\u0027** anymore because it increase the number of Mouse-clicks which require**lots of attention** of my**\u0027Eyes\u0027** . And also consume extra time. If **\u0027Partition 2\u0027** will already be show in the File Explorer then it would be more easy task for me to select \u0027Win 8.1 ISO\u0027 file..............  \n\n**Special Request-** Till now I always used **\u0027RMPrepUSB\u0027** in order to format and create **\u0027Partition 1\u0027** . I think \u0027UFD FORMAT\u0027 will be more useful if it will also add manually **\u0027Partition Size\u0027** option in order to create **\u0027Partition 2\u0027** of **desired Size**along with 75%, 50%, 25%, MAX, MIN.............  \n\nI have lots of Hope from you.............  \n\nPlease Help me.............  \n\nThanks in Advance  \n\n![:cheers:](https://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif)   \n\n**Edited by devdevadev, 20 June 2014 - 07:48 AM.**\n"

      "content": "\u003e This is my Adata 32 GB USB flash disk with two partitions:  \n\u003e\n\u003e **EDIT:** Alternative format procedure used: I just made a multipartition USB stick using RMPrepUSB for the first primary active partition and EasyUS PartitionMaster 10 to make an unformated second primary partition, later using BootIce formated it to exFAT.  \n\u003e\n\u003e 1.- First primary partition 1.9 GB FAT32 type 0C active partition; used UEFI_MULTI to copy Win8.1SE_x64 boot.wim file to root, an several other ISO\u0027s to directory Images, and make the boot files and EFI folder also Grub4dos mbr and grldr and make BCD option to boot Grub4dos. + I manually added BootIce, Hitachi Microdrive Filter Driver folder and Karyonix -- diskmod.sys folder (both having x64 versions)  \n\u003e\n\u003e 2.- Second primary partition 28 GB exFAT; after make it visible to windows using BootIce, manualy copied Win7 and Win8 install ISO\u0027s, + WinNTSetup (BootIce included in tools folder), Hitachi Microdrive Filter Driver folder and Karyonix -- diskmod.sys folder, then make visible to windows the FAT32 partition.  \n\u003e\n\u003e 3.- Boot from USB to Win8.1SE_x64 boot.wim***(it was a MBR PC, I don\u0027t have my UEFI win8 laptop with me at the moment)*** , I tried to install diskmod.sys to be able to see the second partition too, a message saying something like \"Windows has the best driver already installed\" and no way to install it, same hapend when tried Hitachi microdriver, so the other alternative I had just in case was BootIce and make the second partition visible to windows, then using WinNTSetup is possible to install 7 or 8.  \n\u003e\n\u003e ***4.- I reboot again from USB to Win8.1SE_x64 boot.wim this time I let the second partition visible, It booted just fine, so no need to switch back every boot.***   \n\u003e\n\u003e Well after this loooong history I would like to suggest:  \n\u003e\n\u003e ***I) Add to your UFD_FORMAT tool the option to select FAT32 size in MB or GB, now is the remaining from NTFS selection (with new thumb drives sizes 25% for FAT32 to put some WinPE\u0027s may be to much), perhaps remove this option from NTFS and just use the remaining from first partition selection.***  \n\u003e\n\u003e II) Add exFAT as an option for the second partition format. Since long time ago XP-SP2 and newer systems are able to read and write in exFAT formated Volumes, I have been using this format for more than a year in all my USB flash disks, and I can tell you it is faster than NTFS, also it\u0027s able to content VHD\u0027s of big size and open them through Grub4Dos, another plus is files don\u0027t get fragmented so easy as in NTFS and finally less wear to your stick.  \n\u003e\n\u003e Also if you allow me I have a question: ***Could it be possible to inject a filter driver to Win8.1SE_x64 to make it see both partitions?*** , it\u0027s not so important but I would like to know.  \n\u003e\n\u003e My UEFI_MULTI USB stick: [https://www.mediafir...fs585eq7tazlh61](https://www.mediafire.com/?fs585eq7tazlh61 \"External link\")  \n\u003e\n\u003e Filter drivers: [http://www.mediafire..._in_Windows.rar](http://www.mediafire.com/download/csag3vd1p7khrbz/Filter_Drivers_%E2%80%93_Removable_Media_as_Fixed_Disk_in_Windows.rar \"External link\")  \n\u003e\n\u003e Best Regards  \n\u003e\n\u003e **Added-** ***alternative format procedure followed to get partition sizes as required.***\n\n\u003e **3.- Boot from USB to Win8.1SE_x64 boot.wim. I let the second partition visible to Windows,**\n\u003e\n\u003e **It booted just fine, so no****need to switch back every boot.**\n\nHi **\u0027alacran\u0027**.............  \n\nFirst lots of thanks for sharing lots of useful and precious information regarding booting of ***Dual Partition \u0027Removable\u0027*** USB Drive.  \n***--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------***  \n**One month ago you said that*****\u0027You don\u0027t have your UEFI win8 laptop with you at the moment.***   \n***--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------***\n\n**Have you got your UEFI based Win 8 laptop ?** **OR still not now ?**  \n\nWhenever you got your **UEFI** based Win 8 laptop then please boot from ADATA USB ***(Let the second partition visible to Windows***) to Win8.1SE_x64 boot.wim in **UEFI** mode. And If it booted fine, then\n\nplease inform me......................  \n\nNow my***Special Configuration*** is waiting for your precious reply after booted in UEFI based PC................  \n\nThanks for Everything.............\n\n**Edited by devdevadev, 20 June 2014 - 09:48 AM.**\n"
