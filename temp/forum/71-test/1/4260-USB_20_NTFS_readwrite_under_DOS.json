      "content": "G\u0027day everyone ![:D](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/biggrin.png)  \n\nI have been browsing these forums for quite a while and reading over posts by members, which have helped me get a better enderstanding of VistaPE and other various \u0027booting methods\u0027. You definitely seem to know a substantial amount about this topic , and I\u0027ve wasted days and had a ton of frustration with inconsistencies and lack of information into what I\u0027ve been researching. I\u0027m hoping some of you chaps could help me out if at all possible. :cool:   \n\nNow to the juice...   \n\nI need to have the following functionality on a bootable USB thumb drive:  \n\n- USB 2.0 speeds  \n- Ability to execute command line utilities and commands \\[DOS shell\\]  \n- NTFS read/write  \n- Partitionable drive  \n\nIt\u0027s just a project I\u0027ve set out to do, and I need a little help. It may seem rediculous, but I use it to backup files off systems which have no boot capability \\[ruined FS, registry, BSOD\u0027s, corrupt MBR/bootector\\]. Transferring many GB\u0027s over USB 1.x takes a VERY LONG time.  \n\nAfter I am able to achieve this, I am also looking at customizing a VistaPE build, while using USB 2.0 during bootup. This will come later though.  \n\n**USB 2.0 speeds**   \n\nThis is the main issue; everything else can be done, although a little slowly. I\u0027ve used two drivers under DOS known as usbaspi.sys \\[detects USB media\\] and di1000dd.sys \\[maps media to drive letters, acoompanies first driver\\]  \n\nInfo on these can be found here: [http://www.computing...orum/13288.html](http://www.computing.net/dos/wwwboard/forum/13288.html \"External link\")  \n\nWhen these are loaded from RAM after a copy from the bootable USB, NTSDOS will not detect and NTS drives on the system. When I load these via a bootable floppy with the USB still connected, two out of three are detected. Seems a little weird, and always booting via floppy to install drivers is just not going to happen in my opinion; it\u0027s too impractical, very slow, prone to corruption and most new systems don\u0027t come with a floppy drive.  \n\nI found an alternative, which I extracted from the XPe SP2 FP 2007 setup, called ufdprep.exe. I tried it under VMWare and it booted without problems, although I\u0027m yet to verify if it runs at USB 2.0 speeds. One hiccup though, it **will** boot if formatted as NTFS, but **won\u0027t** if formatted as FAT32 \\[even though I\u0027ve been able to boot from a FAT32 USB using other bootsectors, and others have had success: [http://www.911cd.net...l\u003dpetousb fat32](http://www.911cd.net/forums//index.php?showtopic\u003d20016\u0026hl\u003dpetousb+fat32 \"External link\")\\]  \n\nNow, if I have a NTFS formatted drive, I either need to have a second partition as FAT16/FAT32 or somehow use DOS commands on a NTFS drive \\[which isn\u0027t possible, is it? :thumbsup:\\]. I tried adding a DOS floppy bootsector to NTLDR \\[which I copied onto the root of the partition I had formatted with ufdprep\\], following the steps in the following two pages as best as I could:  \n\n[http://www.bcpl.net/...-dual-boot.html](http://www.bcpl.net/~dbryan/ntfs-dual-boot.html \"External link\")  \n[http://www.tburke.ne...cking_guide.htm](http://www.tburke.net/info/ntldr/ntldr_hacking_guide.htm \"External link\")  \n\nThe bootsector thinks the floppy drive is where it should be heading to, which in VMWare works, but in reality does not \\[\"Disk I/O error...\"\\]. None of these, either real of virtual, are doing what I want it to do. I want the bootsector to look for the DOS bootdisk files that I have copied onto the second partition on the USB \\[formatted as a FAT variant\\].   \n\nSo I try to install DOS onto the USB\u0027s FAT partition \\[which I had set as active\\] and what do you know, it formats my OS hard drive \\[even though it was NTFS, which I thought it wouldn\u0027t recognise as a valid drive\\]. So, after all my work on this was stored on that HDD, I\u0027m essentially back to square one after an OS reinstall. I really don\u0027t want to try to find out what I had been working with again and start re-fiddling.  \n\n**Ability to execute command line utilities \\[DOS shell\\]**   \n\nNo worries here, I\u0027ve been using HP\u0027s USB Disk Storage Format Tool to write a bootsector/MBR to the drive. After that I just copy over whatever files I want to use and they work fine. The drawback here is no USB 2.0 support, which I\u0027m after.  \n\n**NTFS read/write**   \n\nI have Sysinternals\u0027 NTFSDOS Professional which works under DOS for the most part. The part where it doesn\u0027t work is when I load the USB 2.0 drivers via both methods described above. NTFS partitions are mounted and they are easily accessible if those USB drivers \\[usbaspi.sys and di1000dd.sys\\] aren\u0027t installed beforehand. The system locks up if I try to load those drivers after I have started NTFSDOS Professional.  \n\n**Partitionable drive**   \n\nI have a driver that does this fine, but I have to change drivers back to default consistently to be able to use some tools \\[drive is recognised as \u0027non removable\u0027 when the custom driver is installed\\]. Is there anything out there that will allow me to hotswap drivers or get the drive recognised as a removable disk, yet remain partitionable? \\[The first is the preferrred, as I\u0027m sure Windows makes it completely impossible to partition and access removable drives  \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  \n\nSo, after scanning all that mess \\^, any ideas? :tabletalk:   \n\nIf there\u0027s any more info you need, please, just say the word. I should be able to recall most of what I have used. My sincere thanks goes to people who have read this opst, and even moreso to those who are able to throw some ideas out there. :D  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nOh, and while I think of it, what\u0027s the difference between a Master Boot Record and Boot Sector? Im under the \\*impression\\* that the MBR resides in the bootsector.... if so, what\u0027s the point of being able to isolate them?  \n\nEDIT: If you have read through the rest of the posts in this thread, you will see that I have solved the problem and created a tutorial on how to achieve the same results yourself. I have attached the tutorial to this post for easy access :D  \n\n#### Attached Files {#attach_wrap}\n\n* [![Attached File](http://reboot.pro/public/style_extra/mime_types/zip.gif)](http://reboot.pro/index.php?s\u003dca02bde4f640d6b51d7617064b8d48f9\u0026app\u003dcore\u0026module\u003dattach\u0026section\u003dattach\u0026attach_id\u003d4860 \"Download attachment\") [**howto_updated.zip**](http://reboot.pro/index.php?s\u003dca02bde4f640d6b51d7617064b8d48f9\u0026app\u003dcore\u0026module\u003dattach\u0026section\u003dattach\u0026attach_id\u003d4860 \"Download attachment\") **29.73KB** 2463 downloads\n\n"

After a little re-reading, it appears that I was mistaken. It\u0027s just a bootsector write utility, which isn\u0027t much of a help when I look at it now because I already use the HP utility to write them when I boot to DOS. I think I am understanding things a little better than I was previously; in hindsight some of my previous ideas about methods of booting don\u0027t make sense. :cool:  \n\nHere\u0027s a PDF which addresses the subject, although I think I need to dig up XPe to follow it through: [http://pheatt.empori...SB_Bootable.pdf](http://pheatt.emporia.edu/projects/bootable/Windows_USB_Bootable.pdf \"External link\")  \n\n\u003e In order to boot DOS, the partition on the USB stick needs to be formatted as either FAT16 or FAT32.  \n\u003e\n\u003e The best DOS disk containing USB dos drivers can be found here:  \n\u003e [http://johnson.tmfc....dos/usbdrv.html](http://johnson.tmfc.net/dos/usbdrv.html \"External link\")  \n\u003e\n\u003e Whether they support USB 2.0 speed, I cannot say.\n\nWell, I\u0027m aware that DOS cannot be loaded unless it\u0027s on a FAT16 or FAT32 partition, so we\u0027re on the same level there.

There are a few others, but they\u0027re only USB 1.x; the Panasonic driver \\[usbaspi - USB 2.0\\] is reported to be the best and support the broadest range of drives, not to mention support the fastest speeds, so that\u0027s what my tests have been using ![:D](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/biggrin.png)  \n\n\u003e I\u0027ll rephrase:  \n\u003e 1) Instead of Xp embedded, try with any of the Native_ex based projects, they are all tested and working.\nYep, I\u0027ve been looking into Native_ex for a few hours. Cheers ![:D](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/biggrin.png)   \n\n\u003e 2) If you want to experiment, have a look at this UNTESTED on USB idea, XPcli\nWell, you tested it and had success, along with almost every other member who posted in that thread. I wouldn\u0027t exactly call that \u0027untested\u0027, but I still failed horribly at an attempt anyway, which proves your point :cool:   \n\n\u003e 3) If you are going down path #2, you will need to add to it USB support, by ADDING yourself the USB drivers AND trying the changes on USB drivers booting order section, detailed on Dietmar\u0027s Tutorials, which you can find in his signature\nSure thing, I didn\u0027t notice them. Thanks for the pointer ![:thumbsup:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/thumbsup.gif)   \n\n\u003e In other words:  \n\u003e 1) Forget using DOS for USB 2.0 speed  \n\u003e 2) Forget about XP embedded\nI guess I knew that was coming, not a worry though; as you have shown me some very valid alternatives that should do the trick just fine  \n\n\u003e 3) Forget about the experimental builds I linked you to\nOK, thanks for linking them in the first place though... :cool:  \n\n\u003e 4) Try using Winbuilder and the Native_ex project(s) to build a minimal USB booting PE:  \n\u003e [http://www.boot-land...s/?showforum\u003d52](http://www.boot-land.net/forums/?showforum\u003d52 \"External link\")  \n\u003e [http://www.boot-land...?showtopic\u003d2376](http://www.boot-land.net/forums/index.php?showtopic\u003d2376 \"External link\")  \n\u003e once, ***and only once*** , you have succeeded building the latter, you may want to try the smallest possible build:  \n\u003e [http://www.boot-land...?showtopic\u003d3910](http://www.boot-land.net/forums/?showtopic\u003d3910 \"External link\")  \n\u003e customizing it to your needs.\nGotcha. I\u0027ll fiddle around and see what I can come up with. Thanks for your replies mate, much appreciated ! ![:tabletalk:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/tabletalk.gif)   \n"

Dietmar\u0027s posts are packed with information, but I have NO CLUE as to how it all ties in. No offense to him, but his English grammatical structure is impossible for me to make sense of. A ton of info, just no idea how to implement it.  \n\nIt just seems like the original idea of using a single driver, which doesn\u0027t happen to function as expected, will cause me to go extravagant measures just to get USB 2.0 speeds. I could spend countless days trying to make head and tail of everything, like I already have; unless it\u0027s just an easy step then for the moment I\u0027m just going to drop it for a few days. I don\u0027t have the motivation presently to try to extract 100\u0027s of pieces of information from everywhere it could possibly be spread to....

      "content": "\u003e Care to share some info in this \"particular\" version of Iomega drivers?  \n\u003e\n\u003e Like version, where did you find it and so on?\n\nWell I grabbed it off a torrent with a ton of DOS boot materials in it \\[all legitimate though, no illegal business\\], and started testing all 8 or so drivers that were included in it. Most were USB 1.x, so I excluded them. The **only** one that works with NTFS software/drivers under DOS is aspiehci.sys \\[only from my testing\\]. For those interested, I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s the latest version, but it works and the other version I tested earlier took a long time to detect the drive and I couldn\u0027t map the FAT partitions on my USB drive \\[errors with the subsequent driver\\]  \n\n**Here\u0027s its info:** Iomega ASPI USB-EHCI 1.0 V.13 09 May 2003  \n**Switches I used:** /all /int  \n\nthe /all switch is used to detect all USB drives possible, not just Iomega drives. Not sure what the /int switch is for, but it\u0027s used in the official config.sys in Iomega\u0027s bootdisk, so I\u0027ve used it. The second driver \\[ASPI Storage block device driver/mapping drives to letters\\] is made by Motto Hairu \\[most peeps have never heard of them\\]. I can attach/upload them if you\u0027d like me to ![:thumbsup:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/thumbsup.gif)  \n\n\u003e Can you also confirm that aspiehci.sys is USB 2.0?\n\nAbsolutely, the results between standard initialisation and using that driver are immense. I transferred 30MB in about 5-7 seconds **from a NTFS partition** as opposed to 4MB in about 25 seconds. Massive difference, and that\u0027s under DOS and using NTFS \\[which isn\u0027t native\\] with the default cache \\[which can be adjusted\\] ![:D](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/biggrin.png)   \n\n\u003e There are three standards compliant controllers in PC\u0027s.
