Now i want to install win 7 on it on partition C where XP is. But My Bios does not support Boot from usb, and i have an External USB DVD drive which works ok.  \n\nPlease can anyone Help me to make my laptop install Win 7 From this USB DVD Drive. Please can someone give me steps. Or is there a cd which can direct my laptop to read from usb dvd drive.  \n\nThanking all in Advance   \n"
