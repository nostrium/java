      "content": "OK, here is the deal. I\u0027m trying to make a multibootable DVD with Win 8 Consumer Preview, Linux Mint, Pinguy Linux and a bunch of iso-based utilities. That\u0027s ok, but I want a couple of folders with some files to throw in there too like \"Drivers\" and \"Extras\" which don\u0027t include anything that needs to be bootable.  \n\nNow I\u0027ve been working on this disc...project for 3 days now and I\u0027m getting very very desperate. I don\u0027t care what tools I have to use, I just want this DVD to work. USB stick is not an option, because booting from it is not supported by this laptop I\u0027m planning to install these operating systems (just for researching and learning purposes).  \n\nTo this date and time I\u0027ve tried to make this multiboot DVD with SARDU, XBOOT and YUMI+ImgBurn. None of them have worked, all for different reasons. SARDU didn\u0027t support Pinguy, and couldn\u0027t get that working.  \n\nWith YUMI I made a perfect booting USB-stick, but I don\u0027t have a clue how to make a bootable\\\u0026burnable ISO/DVD out of it. Tried ImgBurn with different kind of options and boot images, but to no avail. If I try to extract the boot image from this stick with ImgBurn, it\u0027s going to be 16gb big, as is the whole USB-stick (only 8gb of data in there though, should fit in a DVD+R DL). So no burni-burni with that kind of massive boot images.  \n\nClosest I came with XBOOT. I can make an image that multiboots all of my included OS\u0027es and utilities just fine. But how on earth can I add just a simple \"drivers\" folder to that image created with XBOOT? Just plain stupid that this program doesn\u0027t have an option for that! I\u0027ve tried to make an ISO with XBOOT, then edit it with PowerISO (just adding those two dummy folders), but PowerISO fucks it up. After saving that ISO it\u0027s not working anymore. Same thing with extracting the files (either with winrar or mounted to daemon tools) and then building it up again to ISO with ImgBurn. Just cannot get the bootloader/menu to work anymore.  \n\nSo please, someone, tell me how I can finally make this to work. I don\u0027t think I\u0027m asking anything that is overkill, but still there doesn\u0027t seem to be a program(s) around which could make this to happen by just snapping your fingers...a couple of times. Any hints or tips how to make this happen would be much appreciated. So much that I could marry you and buy you a dog. If you\u0027re a girl. If you\u0027re not, then we\u0027re not going to have a dog. Thanks a lot anyway.   \n"

      "content": "Does your PC have USB ports? If it does why not try Plop!  \nYou put put in a bootable Plop CD - the PC boots to Plop - Plop has it\u0027s own USb 2.0 driver - you can then boot from a USB stick from Plop even if the PC does not support USB booting.  \nsee [http://www.plop.at/e....bin.html#runcd](http://www.plop.at/en/bootmanager/plpbt.bin.html#runcd \"External link\")  \nFor reference see Tutorial #60 on my site (though that is about using Plop on a USB drive and not on a CD).  \n\nAny DVD over 4.5GB is going to give you problems even if you can get all the options working. So I strongly suggest the Plop approach - it will be much faster to develop a USB bootable drive (see RMPrepUSB.com site) and use Plop to kick off the boot.  \n\nYou can make a bootable DVD if you include the correct boot file - see [http://sites.google....makegrub4dosiso](https://sites.google.com/a/rmprepusb.com/www/tutorials/makegrub4dosiso \"External link\")   \n"

Thanks a lot anyway.  \nurm ![:dubbio:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/dubbio.gif) , actually what you are asking (i.e. making a massive multi-boot, multi-OS supersize DVD)**is** difficult even for experienced \u0027rebooters\u0027.  \nThe system you are using is obviously not suited to USB booting. Does your project **have** to work on that particular system.  \nWhy not test on another system or just use the RMPrepUSB \u0027test using QEMU\u0027 button to emulate booting from the USB drive (although it does not always work with all images). Or install QEMU Manager or Oracle VM Virtual Box and boot from the ISO file directly as if it was a DVD drive.  \nWhy not start by simplifying the project - get just one (smallest?) to work as you want (either as an ISO or a USB drive) and then add to it. If you have any trouble with any of them detail exactly what you did and we will try to help. As we are not sitting on your shoulder and seeing what it is you are doing, it is difficult to offer constructive advice.  \n\nI know it can be frustrating, but we will try to help.   \n"

      "content": "Hey, really, why can\u0027t I quote text normally on this forum? Only the \"Reply to this topic\" -button works, but it\u0027s pain to copy-paste quotes and don\u0027t know how to add correct headers in these tags to point whom I am quoting from. I don\u0027t have any pop-ups blocked from this site either, but somehow quote-button doesn\u0027t work. ![:(](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/sad.png)  \n\n\u003e The system you are using is obviously not suited to USB booting. Does your project **have**to work on that particular system.\nYes. That\u0027s a spare laptop I have (my old one). I just want to learn an review the use of some linux distros and W8 to myself. Pre this date I\u0027ve always had some major problems trying to either install or get wlan drivers etc. to work on Ubuntu etc. distros and my curiosity has been short lived and then filled with frustration. Last time I tried 2 years ago. This time it isn\u0027t looking much better either.  \n\n\u003e Why not test on another system or just use the RMPrepUSB \u0027test using QEMU\u0027 button to emulate booting from the USB drive (although it does not always work with all images). Or install QEMU Manager or Oracle VM Virtual Box and boot from the ISO file directly as if it was a DVD drive.\nI\u0027ve used Oracle VM Virtual Box and the QEMU included in Xboot the whole time. Cannot risk to burn anymore DVD+R DL or even CD-R duds anymore. My YUMI-made multiboot USB stick is working fantastically on other machines: my main desktop computer I\u0027m writing this reply at the moment, my new laptop and my HTPC. No problems as long as the BIOS is supporting booting from an USB HDD. Problems evolve at the moment I\u0027m trying to either extract the bootable USB-stick to bootable ISO to burn it on to a DVD or when I try to make that Plop ISO to burn it on to a CD-R. And I\u0027m not really sure how can I emulate with VM VB or QEMU a situation where I can have USB recognized but booting disabled on a perfectly booting USB stick and having Plop\u0027s ISO image to load instead and command the USB stick so it would seem I emulate a system which does not support booting from USB.  \n\n\u003e Why not start by simplifying the project - get just one (smallest?) to work as you want (either as an ISO or a USB drive) and then add to it. If you have any trouble with any of them detail exactly what you did and we will try to help. As we are not sitting on your shoulder and seeing what it is you are doing, it is difficult to offer constructive advice.\nYes that has been my approach with all the different methods I\u0027ve tried when trying to create an ISO. I\u0027ve played around with self-bootable Intel SSD firmware update only which is 5 megs or so. I\u0027ve got no problems to make a 10GB multiboot USB stick though, if the bios just supports booting from USB. Unfortunately this is not the case with my laptop.  \n\nSo the only two logical options are either to burn a bootable DVD image with all the necessary crap in it or get something like Plop to drive the stick. Unfortunately I cannot seem to succeed at this. And yes, maybe I just don\u0027t know how to. After tried over a half dozen different programs and all the usage methods, my head is quite messed up with all this already. Thanks for your help and support.   \n"
