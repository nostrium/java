      "content": "Firstly, pardon if this is improper in some way. My search fu is weak.  \n\nSecondly, hi all :smile:  \n\nAnd finally. My question.  \n\nI would like an application that can accomplish the following.  \n\nFormat a USB to be bootable. Resulting USB has a folder for images that when the USB is booted from lists the isos in said folder and allows me to choose which one to boot from. Much like xboot, however...  \n\nHere are the restrictions.  \nI want it to attempt to do this with any iso, I do not want to have to identify it beforehand. (like how do I know if I need to pick grub for dos or syslinux? Both seem to work for the isos I\u0027ve chosen.)  \n\nI do not want to have to know what combination of isos I\u0027ll select beforehand, as with xboot and the like.  \n\nIt\u0027s nice being able to make a key that will boot from a menu of isos, but it sucks to have to completely remake the key if I want to add or remove isos, or having to add or remove isos, with the app. I would prefer it to populate a dynamic list based on the contents of an images folder.  \n\nDoes a tool that meets these requirements exist? If not, is there some reason beyond no one feeling the need to write it, like some technical reason that completely precludes it? I\u0027d like to hear it if so, even if I won\u0027t understand it, just out of curiosity.  \n\nIn terms of future searches what are these mechanics called from a community standard perspective? Like what should I have used as tags for this post for instance?  \n\nThank you for your time and patience. :smile:   \n"

      "content": "It is currently hard, read impossible, to create such **software** application, simply because between each ISO there is a difference and a different workaround is needed.  \n2000/XP/2003 ISO needs one addition. Vista/7/8/Server 2008 second. Ubuntu- third. Fedora- fourth, and so on and so on.  \nThere is no universal workaround for booting just any ISO from USB disk this way. Until ISO booting from USB is standardised, which probably may never happen given the fact this requires all developers involved to take ISO booting into account.  \n\nYou better off have a look at a hardware solution, like [this one](http://reboot.pro/14006/ \"\"), [this one](http://www.i-odd.com/ \"External link\"), or with a little patience [this one](http://reboot.pro/15475/ \"\").  \n\nYou may also want to read this topic:  \n\u003chttp://reboot.pro/8944/\u003e   \n"
