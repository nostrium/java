      "content": "Hi, I\u0027ve a problem. This will be the second time this has happened but not to the same USB hard drive. The drive changed to RAW and of course all my files are unavaliable. I\u0027m wondering if I can repair the boot sector. On the other HD I used Easus Data Recovery Wizard. I was able to recover all my video fies BUT all my eComics and docs where saved in a subfolder labeled RAW. They were scrambled and unusable. If I could repair the boot sector I\u0027m thinkin\u0027 I could save all those files.  \n\nWould TestDisk do it? Or do I risk losing all my video files as well. It\u0027s a 2 Terabyte HD with 1 partition.  \n\nscifi   \n"

If you touch ~~the boot sector~~ , or rather the **MBR** , and it does badly, you can not recover anything after.  \n\nThen I suggest you try some few applications (and need time to a disk that big). Try...  \nRecuva  \nTestDisk and PhotoRec  \nR-Linux  \nGlary Undelete  \nNTFS Undelete  \nRestoration  \netc ...  \nThere are several more applications, free and paid ... But not all work with the same mode and not all may recover any data type ...  \n\nAlso you should keep in mind that if the unit was very fragmented, the files are scattered across the disk, making it more difficult recovery ...  \n\nYou need time, time and patience  \n\nGood luck! and would be grateful that you discuss your results   \n"

      "content": "u2o, you suggested a reply to the solving of my RAW problem: I utilized Easeus Data Recovery 5.5.1 as I had previously on the first RAW converted HD. I decided that it would take even longer to image the HD (plus freeing up an additional 2T HD) so I tried saving the results differenty than I did with the 1st drive that I\u0027d used Easeus on. If one uses this program DON\u0027T attempt to pick out individual extensons (such as .doc or .jpg. JUST RECOVER EVERYTHING! It took just as long (24 hrs) to recover the HD but I recovered the .cbz and .cbr files as well as most everything else (mostly video files). I had attempted to save specific types and the program scrambled the files that didn\u0027t fit into those narrow parameters.   \n"
