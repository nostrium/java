But what I do not meeting for any site on google or reboot.pro and would like you to help me solve it.  \n\nI want to add a boot entry to the BIOS to call any partition of my hard drive to boot regardless in case of mbr main failure.  \n\n![Posted Image](http://www.besttechtips.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/boot-menu.png)  \n\nI say this because all the ways described in this forum depend on the main mbr, but I do not know if you can use another mbr in case of failure of the principal.  \n\nI know that with boot usbs and cds could be solved but , What happens if I have none at that time?.  \n\nPXE not worth for me because I will not hold anything out of my hard drive.  \n\nIs there any way to do or is not possible?.  \n\nSorry for my english and thank you.   \n"

      "content": "I would agree with the above. Modifying the BIOS (or even the UEFI going forward) is a complex and tricky proposition. Even \"experts\" have problems doing this!  \n\nBest bet would be to have a USB drive with a good MBR (or bootable environment) that can be used to \"repair\" a faulty MBR. But just a question...How often or likely is it to be the case that you have a bad MBR and can\u0027t boot - AND you don\u0027t have access to a USB or CD?   \n\n![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif)  \nScott   \n"

In fact, I love carrying around the little [swiss-army knife with a flash drive](http://www.swissknifeshop.com/shop/swiss-army/victorinox/swiss-army-knives/victorinox-flash?gclid\u003dCM6EnZermbACFYeo4AodjBvZ3A \"External link\").

Then it works for a laptop, or a case where you have the NIC on the motherboard without an option ROM available, etc... And, my experience has been that if the MBR is non-functional, that you need more tools to fix things, since access to the other disks or partitions on any hard drive may not be functional. This way you can update it when you need to, but even set it up so it isn\u0027t even mounted by Windows (by default)...  \n\nIn any case, good luck, and if you do build a ROM module, let us know!  \n\n![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif)  \nScott   \n"
