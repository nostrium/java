You will need a separate ISO for Enterprise.  \nNote that the tutorial is for a USB Flash drive and you need to modify the Vista/7 ISO files if you want to use a USB HDD instead. See tutorials #43 for details.   \n"

So use #63 as I said in my post.  \nIf you get Error 15: file not found, then you have not used the correct filename.  \n\nTry the menu entry and the when it goes back to the menu again after the error:  \npress **C**   \nthen type **ls /**   \nyou should see the files in the root of the USB drive listed  \nthen type **ls /_ISO/Windows/** and you should see the Win7 iso listed.  \n\nI have tested this many times on many different systems and it does work - so you have done something wrong.  \nYou just need to follow the instructions. ![:dubbio:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/dubbio.gif)  \nIf you want help with it, please give details - like what menu you are using when you get the error!   \n"
