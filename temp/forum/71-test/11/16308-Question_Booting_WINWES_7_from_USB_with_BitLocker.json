And when I tried to add BitLocker to it, windows said I should set up 2 partitions.  \nSo now I working on creating a bootable WIN/WES 7 USB with 2 partitions.

Use ImageX to make a copy of it (that way you always have a working image to restore if anything goes wrong)  \n2. Wipe disk and create two new NTFS ptns  \n3. ImageX the image onto 2nd ptn  \n4. Run bcdboot onto the first ptnso it makes the first ptn bootable as a boot ptn  \n5. Boot Win 7 and convert to bitlocker (if it will let you!)   \n"
