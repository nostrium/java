      "content": "**Brief Tutorial**   \n\n**1.** The highest bootability (100%) of any USB stick is reached when BIOSes with USB support recognize it as a Hard Disk and then boot it in Hard Disk emulation mode.  \n**2.** About the USB booting many BIOSes are not adequately featured and refuse to boot a USB stick unless it is recognized as a Hard Disk.  \n**3.** Any previous way (except the rarely possible flipping of the removable bit) is not really able to recognize from the BIOS a USB stick as a Hard Disk.  \n**4.** Hard Disks are the only mass storage devices that can be normally partitioned with more than 1 partition.  \n**5.** The partitioning with more than 1 partition is able to fool the most BIOSes that any USB stick is a Hard Disk.  \n**6.** This is the most effective and simple way to achieve the highest bootability of any USB stick.  \n**7.** It might work in 100% of cases.  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n**Preliminary Notes**   \n\nA brief note about naming: as known \"UFD\" is the acronym of **U** SB **F** lash **D** rive and actually it seems the official name for USB Removable Devices.  \n[http://en.wikipedia....sh_drive#Naming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_flash_drive#Naming \"External link\")  \n\"Bootability\" is a term that expresses the concept of hardware-compatibility matched by your UFD vs. your BIOS, so if in your BIOS setup all settings for USB booting are enabled and it fails to boot your bootable UFD then the related bootability is low.  \n[https://www.codidire...bootability.htm](https://www.codidirect.com/shop/thefactsbehindbootability.htm \"External link\")  \n\nRunning some tests in order to increase the bootability of my USB Flash Drive I\u0027ve experienced two simple ways with effective results.  \nThe following two ways are related to existing USB support in the BIOS, that\u0027s just as the most BIOSes have.  \nHere is described what I did in order to boot any UFD from (reasonably) the most machines out there.  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n**1.** The Simplest Way, that I named **Format-it-\\\u0026-Forget-it** .  \n\nAs we all know, even if the most BIOSes are perfectly able to boot a USB Hard Disk, often they completely refuse to boot a USB Flash Drive.  \nSome BIOSes seem to \"assume\" that a USB Flash Drive can not be partitioned, and on the other hands the most BIOSes seem to \"acknowledge\" that a USB Hard Disk can be.  \nSo, if you just create 2 partitions on your UFD then your BIOS will believe that your UFD is a USB Hard Disk just because it is partitioned, and then it will boot!  \n\nNo special tweaking or physical hacking of your UFD is needed and no special tool or utility is used in order to make your UFD bootable: you only need for a filter driver, the XP\u0027s Disk Management console and a boot loader.  \n\nIn order to increase the bootability of your UFD it is enough to create just **2** partitions on it.  \n\nReally it would be impossible due to the fact that Windows allows just one single partition on your UFD, but if you install a Filter Driver under your Windows PC then your UFD will become perfectly partitionable because Windows (thanks to the filter driver just installed) will recognize it like a Hard Disk (Basic Disk) and you can easily partition it using the XP\u0027s Disk Management console (Start \\\u003e Run \\\u003e diskmgmt.msc).  \nPlease note that XP\u0027s Disk Management console still seems the best choice in order to contribute to a high bootability, creating a MBR of your device (with the Partition Table inside) widely and reliably compatible.  \nSo, if you are planning to perform this tutorial, please do NOT use any other partitioning software.  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n**HowTo** :  \n\n1. Download \"soviet_direct_hooking_src.zip\" from here [http://www.codeproje...ct_hooking.aspx](http://www.codeproject.com/KB/system/soviet_direct_hooking.aspx \"External link\")  \nthen unzip it and rename \"dummydisk.sys\" as \"dummy.sys\".  \nCopy \"dummy.sys\" in your \"system32\\\\drivers\" folder and add \"dummy.reg\" to the registry (with a double-click).  \n\n**\"dummy.reg\"**   \n\\[codebox\\]color black/cyan yellow/cyantimeout 30default 0title Active@ Partition Recoverymap --mem /boot/apr.ima (fd0)map --hookchainloader (fd0)+1rootnoverify (fd0)title Linux Parted Magickernel /boot/pmagic/bzImage noapic root\u003d/dev/ram0 init\u003d/linuxrc keymap\u003dus liveusb vga\u003d791 sleep\u003d0 quiet xvesa tmpfs_size\u003d350M ramdisk_size\u003d25000 directory\u003d/bootinitrd /boot/pmagic/initrdtitle Norton Partition Magicmap --mem /boot/npm.ima (fd0)map --hookchainloader (fd0)+1rootnoverify (fd0)title Paragon Total Defragfind --set-root /boot/ptd.isomap --mem /boot/ptd.iso (hd32)map --hookchainloader (hd32)boottitle RecoverSoft Media Tools Promap --mem /boot/mtl.img (fd0)map --hookchainloader (fd0)+1rootnoverify (fd0)title Symantec Ghostmap --mem /boot/gho.ima (fd0)map --hookchainloader (fd0)+1rootnoverify (fd0)title TeraByte BootIt NGmap (hd0,0)/boot/bng.iso (hd32)map --hookchainloader (hd32)title VistaPEmap (hd0,0)/boot/vpe.iso (hd32)map --hookchainloader (hd32)title Windows XP Professionalfind --set-root /ntldrchainloader (hd0,0)/ntldr\\[/codebox\\]6. Done!You just have highly increased the bootability of your UFD.\\[u\\]Since the most BIOSes regularly support USB-HDD booting and now your UFD is seen by the BIOS as an HDD (just because you have partitioned it), then your UFD will boot not only from your PC, but also (reasonably) from the most machines out there!\\[/u\\]\\[b\\]2.\\[/b\\] \\[u\\]The Democratic Way\\[/u\\]: that I named \\[b\\]Format-it-\\\u0026-Boot-it\\[/b\\].Since so many reports refer that the 1st partition in FAT file-system on your UFD would ensure the highest level of hardware compatibility at booting, I thought: why not just provide one?So, in order to even further increase the bootability of your UFD you have to perform the above way with some following differences.\\[b\\]HowTo\\[/b\\]:1. After installing the filter driver as described above then create the 1st partition on your UFD up to 2047 MB in size and format it in FAT file-system.2. Then create the 2nd partition of an appropriate size in FAT32 or NTFS file-system and mark it as active.Really you can create up to 4 primary partitions on your UFD, depending on your needs.\\[url\u003d\"http://www.hostanyimage.com/\"\\]\\[img\\]http://www.hostanyimage.com/files/m6j9fynhz8udvl91356w.png\\[/img\\]\\[/url\\]3. Now install \"grub4dos\" in the MBR of your UFD as described above and copy \"grldr\" and \"menu.lst\" in the root of the 1st partition.4. Edit your \"menu.lst\" file in an appropriate way, create a folder named \"boot\" in the root of the 1st partition (or in any other not-encrypted partition if you have created ones) of your UFD and place into it all you want to load and to select through \"grub4dos\" Menu screen at startup.5. Done!\\[u\\]Now, since so many reports refer that the 1st partition in FAT file-system assures the highest hardware-compatibility (please, read: bootability) then you have just further increased the bootability of your UFD and it will boot (reasonably) even from more machines than performing the previous simplest way!\\[/u\\]Please, note that this way you can run \\[u\\]Multiple XP\\[/u\\], as well as \"Full XP in Single-Booting\", \"Full XP in Dual-Booting\", \"Full XP in Multi-Booting\", \\[u\\]indifferently from the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and/or 4th Active Partition of your UFD\\[/u\\] selecting through \"grub4dos\" Menu screen at startup which you want to load (included all supported applications as ISO, IMA, IMG, etc, if existing); just as described in \\[b\\]Multiple XP on Multi-Partitioned USB Flash Drive\\[/b\\] here \\[url\u003d\"http://www.boot-land.net/forums/index.php?s\u003d\\\u0026showtopic\u003d7466\\\u0026view\u003dfindpost\\\u0026p\u003d62682\"\\]http://www.boot-land.net/forums/index.php?...ost\\\u0026p\u003d62682\\[/url\\]\\[b\\]To add/replace in \"menu.lst\" example for Full XP in Dual-Booting\\[/b\\] (very simplified, thanks to \\[b\\]jaclaz\\[/b\\] and \\[b\\]tinybit\\[/b\\])\\[code\\]title Windows XP Professional \\\u0026#40;from the 2nd partition\\\u0026#41;unhide \\\u0026#40;hd0,1\\\u0026#41;hide \\\u0026#40;hd0,2\\\u0026#41;root \\\u0026#40;hd0,1\\\u0026#41;chainloader /ntldrtitle Windows XP Professional \\\u0026#40;from the 3rd partition\\\u0026#41;unhide \\\u0026#40;hd0,2\\\u0026#41;hide \\\u0026#40;hd0,1\\\u0026#41;root \\\u0026#40;hd0,2\\\u0026#41;chainloader /ntldr\\[/code\\]  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nGood luck!  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n**The Known Background**   \n\nThe most relevant argument explaining why so many issues occur at the booting with USB Flash Drives seems essentially imputable to the lack of an industry-standard USB-oriented common protocol of BIOS manufacturers.  \nThen, accepting that a full - that\u0027s a really universal - hardware-compatibility with all existing BIOSes (modern and of the past) appears as reasonably unreachable, we must seek-out for the most compatibility possible.  \nIf you take a look at the **jaclaz** \u0027s FAQ #10 you can discover that there are many reasons preventing the success at USB-booting.  \n[http://home.graffiti...SB/USBfaqs.html](http://home.graffiti.net/jaclaz:graffiti.net/Projects/USB/USBfaqs.html \"External link\")  \nFurthermore if you read here  \n[http://www.boot-land...showtopic\u003d6546#](http://www.boot-land.net/forums/index.php?showtopic\u003d6546# \"External link\")  \nyou can see again that a real and total compatibility with all BIOSes - even if theoretically declarable - is practically unattainable, at least following an acceptable real and known way.  \nSo we must settle for the widest-possible applicable compatibility.  \n\nReducing too many possible variables in a reasonable number-and/or-circumstances it seems that there are at least two \"easily\" practicable conditions that can ensure to your USB Flash Drive a statistically high-grade of compatibility at USB-booting for a high percentage of machines (that\u0027s of BIOSes), more or less *modern* :  \n1. FAT(16) file-system (as the 1st partition);  \n2. Fixed Disk (as USB Flash Drive behaving like USB-HDD).  \n\nBy the user-side all improving attempts can be made only on what we can change, but obviously (except some BIOS-related projects like \"coreboot.org\") on existing BIOSes we can\u0027t.  \n\nIn other words: if it\u0027s true, and it seems so true, that when a booting fails any BIOS is always \"guilty\" while any UFD is always \"innocent\", then - paradoxically - we are forced to act on the innocent because we can not act on the guilty!  \n\nThis fact implies that you can (almost always) implement just workarounds, not a genuine solution.  \n\nSo the research of a better hardware compatibility (that\u0027s a successfully booting-couple UFD/BIOS) becomes almost exclusively USB Flash Drive related (except the few settings allowed within every BIOS setup) and it represents *de facto* the critical area (and then the bottle-neck, if not the nightmare) where the most procedures and the most efforts are moving in order to maximize and to optimize the results (that\u0027s to reach a wide and reliable booting).  \n\nOne of the most effective, if not absolutely the most effective practice in order to walk-up the best possible booting from USB Flash Drives is related to the flipping of the \"removable bit\" in your physical drive (really in the dedicated controller within your drive) that will be capable to transform your USB Flash Drive just in a physical Basic Disk (that\u0027s exactly as a Hard Disk).  \nThen, it is a solution.  \n\nUnfortunely the results of that practice are \"randomized\" and limited-in-number due to a missing universal-tool capable to do that job on every UFD (although some different utilities are specifically dedicated to some different UFD controllers).  \nAs alternative ways there are some other tools-\\\u0026-utilities developed to format and to make bootable your UFD, and some various techniques more or less complex thought-up in order to reach the wished success at booting, but - despite this - a really wide-\\\u0026-standardized compatibility at USB-booting seems still far to be reached.  \n\nAs already said all reports seem to refer that the FAT(16) file-system assures a high grade of hardware-compatibility (please, read: bootability) with the most BIOSes.  \nUnfortunely the FAT(16) file-system is not efficient, is limited in partition-size, in cluster-size, in waste of disk space and furthermore under Windows your USB Flash Drive can have just one single partition.  \n[http://www.microsoft...v.mspx?mfr\u003dtrue](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windows2000serv/reskit/prork/prdf_fls_tllv.mspx?mfr\u003dtrue \"External link\")  \n\nThen the scenario really does not appear as the most desiderable.  \n\nHowever, there are two Filter Drivers (Anton Bassov\u0027s \"dummydisk.sys\" and Hitachi Microdrive) out there that are able (by software-side) to recognize under Windows your USB Flash Drive just like a Basic Disk and then to make it perfectly partitionable.  \nFurthermore there is a great universal Boot Loader named \"grub4dos\" that has been decisive in order to obtain the described results.  \n\nSo my idea was simple: since the most BIOSes - oldish ones, and newish ones too - strongly prefer at USB-booting the (1st partition in) FAT file-system, why not just provide one?  \n\nAbout both my idea (that I already applied it in the past with a logical partition, but resulting much less versatile) and the \"grub4dos + dummydisk\" wonderful combine, my recent tests have been very exciting and very effective for me; so the above procedure describes how I did and what were the additional advantages that I found.  \n\nOf course I\u0027m very interested in unknown and/or alternative ways equally and/or so widely simple-\\\u0026-effective, thus if somebody knows or has been experienced similar high-bootability results following different and/or better ways please kindly report here in order to possibly redefine the State-of-the-Art about the USB Flash Drive bootability.  \nThank you!  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n**Format-it-\\\u0026-Forget-it** Notes.  \n\nRunning some tests I\u0027ve discovered that the \"point of view\" of the BIOS does not seem the same point of view of Windows and from the point of view of the BIOS it seems no matter if the partitions on your UFD are accessible or not under Windows, because the BIOS however will recognize that your UFD is partitioned and - just for this - it will believe that your UFD is a USB Hard Disk!  \n\nSo, if your BIOS supports USB-HDD feature - like the most BIOSes just do - it will be ENOUGH that your UFD is PARTITIONED - with (at least) 2 partitions - in order to induce the BIOS to BELIEVE that your UFD is just a USB Hard Disk and then it will boot (reasonably) from the most machines out there!  \n\nThis way I was able to boot \"Full XP\" without ANY boot loader except its own (that\u0027s just \"ntldr\") from the active partition of my UFD on a machine that refuses to boot ANYTHING that is not as a Fixed Disk simply partitioning my UFD!  \n\nSo - about the USB booting - the simple partitioning of your UFD seems to succeed EXACTLY as the flipping of removable-bit does and then the bootability of your UFD will result highly increased!  \n\nThen it could be a universal solution, with no price to pay (because few hundreds of megabytes partitioned at the end of your UFD and not accessible from every machine are NOT really a price), and it would NOT be a workaround (because the partitioning on your UFD is REAL and your BIOS will read it very well)!  \n\nA clarification is needed.  \nUnder your Windows PC you may partition your UFD as following: the 1st partition of almost ALL the size of your UFD and the 2nd SMALL partition (in any file-system) at the end of the disk (and that you will not use): this way your UFD will remain with the almost all its size available from every machine WITHOUT any filter driver installed and it does not lose any functionality; furthermore its bootability will be effectively increased because this way it will be able to boot (reasonably) from the most machines.  \n\nSo, this way appears as an EFFECTIVE and contemporarely the SIMPLEST way in order to highly INCREASE your UFD bootability.  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n**Format-it-\\\u0026-Forget-it** (Full XP in Single-Booting, running without any boot loader except its own \"ntldr\")  \n[![Posted Image](http://www.hostanyimage.com/files/nsi23kn8mby7fg0r0zzw.png)](http://www.hostanyimage.com/ \"External link\")  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n**Format-it-\\\u0026-Boot-it** Notes.  \n\nI am literally enthusiastic about the synergy of \"grub4dos + dummydisk\" that I\u0027ve experienced: \"grub4dos\" is GREAT and \"dummydisk\" is GREAT too and they together are wondeful for me: so absolutely synergistic and so absolutely effective!  \n\nParticularly - under \"Full XP\" running from your UFD - \"dummydisk.sys\" has been able to filter ON-THE-FLY the install of all NEW (so never previously recognized) and pre-partitioned USB Flash Drives without the need to PRE-RECOGNIZE them: so it has appeared as the best candidate for this job and most of all for the creation of partition\u0027s image-backups as well as UNIVERSALLY restorable without modifications (except two lines in your \"boot.ini\" AFTER the restoring on a different numbered partition) on every new UFD, and on every partition of your UFD you want to boot from (1st, 2nd, 3rd and/or 4th).  \nThis fact means that you will NOT need to re-create (or to modify) your partition\u0027s image-backups (or your XP installation) for every new UFD you want to use: the same backup (even of an encrypted partition) will be working for all your USB Flash Drives: also for those that you have not yet purchased!  \nFurthermore, \"dummydisk\" Filter Driver can be integrate in your customized (with nLite, as an example, just as I did) XP Installation CD-ROM with the same above results, that\u0027s with a full POST-COMPATIBILITY with every new UFD, and then ensuring a high-grade of versatility.  \n\n\"***You cannot have your cake and eat it*** \",  \nthen you have to pay the price of a compromise: however in my opinion it will be a (relatively) small price to pay considering the reached advantages.  \n\nThe price to pay:  \n1. Only ONE partition will be accessible under Windows when you will attach NOT FOR BOOTING (as if you boot with your UFD all its partitions will be regularly allowed) your UFD under those machines where is NOT already installed a Filter Driver.  \n\nThe benefits:  \n1. You can boot your UFD from (reasonably) the most machines with a high-grade of success: as already said now my UFD is able to boot even from a machine that refuses to boot ANYTHING that is not as a Fixed Disk!  \n2. Simple \"newbie-proof\" procedure.  \n3. No special tweaking or physical hacking of your UFD will be needed and no special tool or utility will be used in order to make your UFD bootable, neither \"HP USB Disk Storage Format Tool\" nor \"PeToUSB\" utility, nor \"Lexar BootIt\", nor other ones: this procedure implies both the widest (reasonable) compatibility and the simplest usage.  \n4. You can easily \"translate\" your current \"Windows XP Professional SP3\" running from your current PC into \"Full XP from your UFD\" with the minimal tweaking possible.  \n5. You can restore either your \"Full XP\" installation or your UFD partition\u0027s image-backups to every new UFD without ANY modification (except two lines in your \"boot.ini\" AFTER the restoring on a different numbered partition) and WITHOUT both to pre-install your new UFD or to create a new partition\u0027s image-backup (or to modify your XP installation).  \n6. You can encrypt (with TrueCrypt) your UFD System Drive with no issue.  \n7. You can restore a RAW image-backup of your UFD encrypted System Partition to every new UFD without any modification (except a quick and easy TrueCrypt \"key data/volume header\" restoring from its Menu screen).  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n**Format-it-\\\u0026-Boot-it** (Full XP in Dual Booting, running from the 3rd Active Partition)  \n[![Posted Image](http://www.hostanyimage.com/files/27418583k1qigwz7z9n9.png)](http://www.hostanyimage.com/ \"External link\")   \n"

Rather than altering your installed OS with a third party driver.  \nNote gParted does not bother the mbr, I have tested this on a working bootable usb. I even messed up and had to move the first partition twice, after which it still booted without any issues. Nor, does it affect files/directories as it is data losseless.  \n\nAlso by \u0027copying the files\u0027 I simply meant if you wished to place any files in the second partition (such as a second copy of PE) you could do so from within Puppy Linux aswell. Since using this method to partition will not allow access to it thru windows.  \n\nI just thought that this might be an easy way for him to get the usb partitioned since he was having trouble with the filter driver, not that you should alter the howto or anything (great job btw Thanks).  \n\nI have tried both drivers myself but still prefer to reboot from cd over installing and then uninstalling these.  \n\nSonny   \n"

      "content": "\u003e I used microdrive\nMany thanks, now we know that Hitachi Microdrive seems more compatible compared to dummydisk (really I\u0027m not too surprised by that).  \nSo if you do not plane to buid your UFD with a Full XP then Microdrive seems a better choice.  \nAt least in this thread, it has just become the preferred, and then the **official** Filter Driver! ![:good:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/good.gif) ![^_^](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/happy.png)  \n\nIn my opinion, \"dummydisk\" is a bit less stable, but with the GREAT feature to install/filter ON-THE-FLY every new UFD without any user-input.  \nIt\u0027s enough to *handle* it with a little care and it pays you with a really great job, especially in some circumstances. ![^_^](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/happy.png)  \n\n\u003e Rather than altering your installed OS with a third party driver.\nReally it seems no matter, in my opinion (since you have to use a filter driver for a *noble* reason, and AFAIK without simpler alternatives, not for sport ![^_^](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/happy.png)).  \nIf you do not like to let some traces of any software in your Windows PC (and of course I generally agree) then you can download the freeware open-source \"ODIN - Open Disk Imager in a Nutshell\" - as an example - from here [http://odin-win.sourceforge.net/](http://odin-win.sourceforge.net/ \"External link\") , create an image-backup of your working partition before any undesirable software installation and then you can restore that image-backup on your now \"used\" partition.  \nAll in few minutes, and just what I do when needed. ![^_^](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/happy.png)  \nHowever \"dummydisk\" is easily uninstallable: it\u0027s enough to remove one registry key and one file and it will not \"disturb\" you more.  \nFurthermore \"dummydisk\" is needed (not optional) if you plane to build some finely working configurations on your UFD running a Full XP from.  \n\nHowever, I understand and partially agree your point of view, but can you see mine? ![^_^](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/happy.png)  \nHere the efforts are directed towards a broad compatibility and - as already mentioned - Disk Management console under Windows XP still seems the best choice (AFAIK).  \nEven if you have been able to boot from your machine your UFD just formatted by GParted it is not meaning that your UFD could boot from another machine, and probably it could not.  \nHere we are talking about an increased bootability, that\u0027s about a wide-compatibility and there are many reports out there, not only my experienced issues, that refer about XP\u0027s Disk Management Console related excellence when it creates the MBR of your disk (with the Partition Table inside).   \n"

[http://www.911cd.net...showtopic\u003d21850](http://www.911cd.net/forums//index.php?showtopic\u003d21850 \"External link\")  \n\nOn the other hands, with any USB stick larger than 512 MB (and without the removable-bit flipped, that\u0027s just as a USB removable device) and up to 32 GB (I\u0027ve tested every size up to 32 GB) any other procedure (HP Format Tool included) in order to make it bootable from my testing-machine had failed and any USB stick will not boot in ANY way except if it has more than 1 partition.  \n\nThis fact means that HP Format Tool is not really able to fool the BIOS of my testing-machine into believing that my USB stick is a Hard Disk, because then the BIOS of my testing-machine does NOT boot when a USB stick is formatted by HP Format Tool or prepared in any other procedure.  \n\nInstead, the same BIOS perfectly boots a USB stick of every size when I create more than 1 partition on it.  \n\nPlease, do your own conclusions.  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nEvery your further report will be more than welcome!   \n"

Done!You just have highly increased the bootability of your UFD.\\[u\\]Since the most BIOSes regularly support USB-HDD booting and now your UFD is seen by the BIOS as an HDD (just because you have partitioned it), then your UFD will boot not only from your PC, but also (reasonably) from the most machines out there!\\[/u\\]\\[b\\]2.\\[/b\\] \\[u\\]The Democratic Way\\[/u\\]: that I named \\[b\\]Format-it-\\\u0026-Boot-it\\[/b\\].Since so many reports refer that the 1st partition in FAT file-system on your UFD would ensure the highest level of hardware compatibility at booting, I thought: why not just provide one?So, in order to even further increase the bootability of your UFD you have to perform the above way with some following differences.\\[b\\]HowTo\\[/b\\]:1. After installing the filter driver as described above then create the 1st partition on your UFD up to 2047 MB in size and format it in FAT file-system.2. Then create the 2nd partition of an appropriate size in FAT32 or NTFS file-system and mark it as active.Really you can create up to 4 primary partitions on your UFD, depending on your needs.\\[url\u003d\"http://www.hostanyimage.com/\"\\]\\[img\\]http://www.hostanyimage.com/files/m6j9fynhz8udvl91356w.png\\[/img\\]\\[/url\\]3. Now install \"grub4dos\" in the MBR of your UFD as described above and copy \"grldr\" and \"menu.lst\" in the root of the 1st partition.4. Edit your \"menu.lst\" file in an appropriate way, create a folder named \"boot\" in the root of the 1st partition (or in any other not-encrypted partition if you have created ones) of your UFD and place into it all you want to load and to select through \"grub4dos\" Menu screen at startup.5. Done!\\[u\\]Now, since so many reports refer that the 1st partition in FAT file-system assures the highest hardware-compatibility (please, read: bootability) then you have just further increased the bootability of your UFD and it will boot (reasonably) even from more machines than performing the previous simplest way!\\[/u\\]Please, note that this way you can run \\[u\\]Multiple XP\\[/u\\], as well as \"Full XP in Single-Booting\", \"Full XP in Dual-Booting\", \"Full XP in Multi-Booting\", \\[u\\]indifferently from the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and/or 4th Active Partition of your UFD\\[/u\\] selecting through \"grub4dos\" Menu screen at startup which you want to load (included all supported applications as ISO, IMA, IMG, etc, if existing); just as described in \\[b\\]Multiple XP on Multi-Partitioned USB Flash Drive\\[/b\\] here \\[url\u003d\"http://www.boot-land.net/forums/index.php?s\u003d\\\u0026showtopic\u003d7466\\\u0026view\u003dfindpost\\\u0026p\u003d62682\"\\]http://www.boot-land.net/forums/index.php?...ost\\\u0026p\u003d62682\\[/url\\]\\[b\\]To add/replace in \"menu.lst\" example for Full XP in Dual-Booting\\[/b\\] (very simplified, thanks to \\[b\\]jaclaz\\[/b\\] and \\[b\\]tinybit\\[/b\\])\\[code\\]title Windows XP Professional \\\u0026#40;from the 2nd partition\\\u0026#41;unhide \\\u0026#40;hd0,1\\\u0026#41;hide \\\u0026#40;hd0,2\\\u0026#41;root \\\u0026#40;hd0,1\\\u0026#41;chainloader /ntldrtitle Windows XP Professional \\\u0026#40;from the 3rd partition\\\u0026#41;unhide \\\u0026#40;hd0,2\\\u0026#41;hide \\\u0026#40;hd0,1\\\u0026#41;root \\\u0026#40;hd0,2\\\u0026#41;chainloader /ntldr\\[/code\\]  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nGood luck!  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n**The Known Background**   \n\nThe most relevant argument explaining why so many issues occur at the booting with USB Flash Drives seems essentially imputable to the lack of an industry-standard USB-oriented common protocol of BIOS manufacturers.  \nThen, accepting that a full - that\u0027s a really universal - hardware-compatibility with all existing BIOSes (modern and of the past) appears as reasonably unreachable, we must seek-out for the most compatibility possible.  \nIf you take a look at the **jaclaz** \u0027s FAQ #10 you can discover that there are many reasons preventing the success at USB-booting.  \n[http://home.graffiti...SB/USBfaqs.html](http://home.graffiti.net/jaclaz:graffiti.net/Projects/USB/USBfaqs.html \"External link\")  \nFurthermore if you read here  \n[http://www.boot-land...showtopic\u003d6546#](http://www.boot-land.net/forums/index.php?showtopic\u003d6546# \"External link\")  \nyou can see again that a real and total compatibility with all BIOSes - even if theoretically declarable - is practically unattainable, at least following an acceptable real and known way.  \nSo we must settle for the widest-possible applicable compatibility.  \n\nReducing too many possible variables in a reasonable number-and/or-circumstances it seems that there are at least two \"easily\" practicable conditions that can ensure to your USB Flash Drive a statistically high-grade of compatibility at USB-booting for a high percentage of machines (that\u0027s of BIOSes), more or less *modern* :  \n1. FAT(16) file-system (as the 1st partition);  \n2. Fixed Disk (as USB Flash Drive behaving like USB-HDD).  \n\nBy the user-side all improving attempts can be made only on what we can change, but obviously (except some BIOS-related projects like \"coreboot.org\") on existing BIOSes we can\u0027t.  \n\nIn other words: if it\u0027s true, and it seems so true, that when a booting fails any BIOS is always \"guilty\" while any UFD is always \"innocent\", then - paradoxically - we are forced to act on the innocent because we can not act on the guilty!  \n\nThis fact implies that you can (almost always) implement just workarounds, not a genuine solution.  \n\nSo the research of a better hardware compatibility (that\u0027s a successfully booting-couple UFD/BIOS) becomes almost exclusively USB Flash Drive related (except the few settings allowed within every BIOS setup) and it represents *de facto* the critical area (and then the bottle-neck, if not the nightmare) where the most procedures and the most efforts are moving in order to maximize and to optimize the results (that\u0027s to reach a wide and reliable booting).  \n\nOne of the most effective, if not absolutely the most effective practice in order to walk-up the best possible booting from USB Flash Drives is related to the flipping of the \"removable bit\" in your physical drive (really in the dedicated controller within your drive) that will be capable to transform your USB Flash Drive just in a physical Basic Disk (that\u0027s exactly as a Hard Disk).  \nThen, it is a solution.  \n\nUnfortunely the results of that practice are \"randomized\" and limited-in-number due to a missing universal-tool capable to do that job on every UFD (although some different utilities are specifically dedicated to some different UFD controllers).  \nAs alternative ways there are some other tools-\\\u0026-utilities developed to format and to make bootable your UFD, and some various techniques more or less complex thought-up in order to reach the wished success at booting, but - despite this - a really wide-\\\u0026-standardized compatibility at USB-booting seems still far to be reached.  \n\nAs already said all reports seem to refer that the FAT(16) file-system assures a high grade of hardware-compatibility (please, read: bootability) with the most BIOSes.  \nUnfortunely the FAT(16) file-system is not efficient, is limited in partition-size, in cluster-size, in waste of disk space and furthermore under Windows your USB Flash Drive can have just one single partition.  \n[http://www.microsoft...v.mspx?mfr\u003dtrue](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windows2000serv/reskit/prork/prdf_fls_tllv.mspx?mfr\u003dtrue \"External link\")  \n\nThen the scenario really does not appear as the most desiderable.  \n\nHowever, there are two Filter Drivers (Anton Bassov\u0027s \"dummydisk.sys\" and Hitachi Microdrive) out there that are able (by software-side) to recognize under Windows your USB Flash Drive just like a Basic Disk and then to make it perfectly partitionable.  \nFurthermore there is a great universal Boot Loader named \"grub4dos\" that has been decisive in order to obtain the described results.  \n\nSo my idea was simple: since the most BIOSes - oldish ones, and newish ones too - strongly prefer at USB-booting the (1st partition in) FAT file-system, why not just provide one?  \n\nAbout both my idea (that I already applied it in the past with a logical partition, but resulting much less versatile) and the \"grub4dos + dummydisk\" wonderful combine, my recent tests have been very exciting and very effective for me; so the above procedure describes how I did and what were the additional advantages that I found.  \n\nOf course I\u0027m very interested in unknown and/or alternative ways equally and/or so widely simple-\\\u0026-effective, thus if somebody knows or has been experienced similar high-bootability results following different and/or better ways please kindly report here in order to possibly redefine the State-of-the-Art about the USB Flash Drive bootability.  \nThank you!  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n**Format-it-\\\u0026-Forget-it** Notes.  \n\nRunning some tests I\u0027ve discovered that the \"point of view\" of the BIOS does not seem the same point of view of Windows and from the point of view of the BIOS it seems no matter if the partitions on your UFD are accessible or not under Windows, because the BIOS however will recognize that your UFD is partitioned and - just for this - it will believe that your UFD is a USB Hard Disk!  \n\nSo, if your BIOS supports USB-HDD feature - like the most BIOSes just do - it will be ENOUGH that your UFD is PARTITIONED - with (at least) 2 partitions - in order to induce the BIOS to BELIEVE that your UFD is just a USB Hard Disk and then it will boot (reasonably) from the most machines out there!  \n\nThis way I was able to boot \"Full XP\" without ANY boot loader except its own (that\u0027s just \"ntldr\") from the active partition of my UFD on a machine that refuses to boot ANYTHING that is not as a Fixed Disk simply partitioning my UFD!  \n\nSo - about the USB booting - the simple partitioning of your UFD seems to succeed EXACTLY as the flipping of removable-bit does and then the bootability of your UFD will result highly increased!  \n\nThen it could be a universal solution, with no price to pay (because few hundreds of megabytes partitioned at the end of your UFD and not accessible from every machine are NOT really a price), and it would NOT be a workaround (because the partitioning on your UFD is REAL and your BIOS will read it very well)!  \n\nA clarification is needed.  \nUnder your Windows PC you may partition your UFD as following: the 1st partition of almost ALL the size of your UFD and the 2nd SMALL partition (in any file-system) at the end of the disk (and that you will not use): this way your UFD will remain with the almost all its size available from every machine WITHOUT any filter driver installed and it does not lose any functionality; furthermore its bootability will be effectively increased because this way it will be able to boot (reasonably) from the most machines.  \n\nSo, this way appears as an EFFECTIVE and contemporarely the SIMPLEST way in order to highly INCREASE your UFD bootability.  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n**Format-it-\\\u0026-Forget-it** (Full XP in Single-Booting, running without any boot loader except its own \"ntldr\")  \n[![Posted Image](http://www.hostanyimage.com/files/nsi23kn8mby7fg0r0zzw.png)](http://www.hostanyimage.com/ \"External link\")  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n**Format-it-\\\u0026-Boot-it** Notes.  \n\nI am literally enthusiastic about the synergy of \"grub4dos + dummydisk\" that I\u0027ve experienced: \"grub4dos\" is GREAT and \"dummydisk\" is GREAT too and they together are wondeful for me: so absolutely synergistic and so absolutely effective!  \n\nParticularly - under \"Full XP\" running from your UFD - \"dummydisk.sys\" has been able to filter ON-THE-FLY the install of all NEW (so never previously recognized) and pre-partitioned USB Flash Drives without the need to PRE-RECOGNIZE them: so it has appeared as the best candidate for this job and most of all for the creation of partition\u0027s image-backups as well as UNIVERSALLY restorable without modifications (except two lines in your \"boot.ini\" AFTER the restoring on a different numbered partition) on every new UFD, and on every partition of your UFD you want to boot from (1st, 2nd, 3rd and/or 4th).  \nThis fact means that you will NOT need to re-create (or to modify) your partition\u0027s image-backups (or your XP installation) for every new UFD you want to use: the same backup (even of an encrypted partition) will be working for all your USB Flash Drives: also for those that you have not yet purchased!  \nFurthermore, \"dummydisk\" Filter Driver can be integrate in your customized (with nLite, as an example, just as I did) XP Installation CD-ROM with the same above results, that\u0027s with a full POST-COMPATIBILITY with every new UFD, and then ensuring a high-grade of versatility.  \n\n\"***You cannot have your cake and eat it*** \",  \nthen you have to pay the price of a compromise: however in my opinion it will be a (relatively) small price to pay considering the reached advantages.  \n\nThe price to pay:  \n1. Only ONE partition will be accessible under Windows when you will attach NOT FOR BOOTING (as if you boot with your UFD all its partitions will be regularly allowed) your UFD under those machines where is NOT already installed a Filter Driver.  \n\nThe benefits:  \n1. You can boot your UFD from (reasonably) the most machines with a high-grade of success: as already said now my UFD is able to boot even from a machine that refuses to boot ANYTHING that is not as a Fixed Disk!  \n2. Simple \"newbie-proof\" procedure.  \n3. No special tweaking or physical hacking of your UFD will be needed and no special tool or utility will be used in order to make your UFD bootable, neither \"HP USB Disk Storage Format Tool\" nor \"PeToUSB\" utility, nor \"Lexar BootIt\", nor other ones: this procedure implies both the widest (reasonable) compatibility and the simplest usage.  \n4. You can easily \"translate\" your current \"Windows XP Professional SP3\" running from your current PC into \"Full XP from your UFD\" with the minimal tweaking possible.  \n5. You can restore either your \"Full XP\" installation or your UFD partition\u0027s image-backups to every new UFD without ANY modification (except two lines in your \"boot.ini\" AFTER the restoring on a different numbered partition) and WITHOUT both to pre-install your new UFD or to create a new partition\u0027s image-backup (or to modify your XP installation).  \n6. You can encrypt (with TrueCrypt) your UFD System Drive with no issue.  \n7. You can restore a RAW image-backup of your UFD encrypted System Partition to every new UFD without any modification (except a quick and easy TrueCrypt \"key data/volume header\" restoring from its Menu screen).  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n**Format-it-\\\u0026-Boot-it** (Full XP in Dual Booting, running from the 3rd Active Partition)  \n[![Posted Image](http://www.hostanyimage.com/files/27418583k1qigwz7z9n9.png)](http://www.hostanyimage.com/ \"External link\")   \n"

      "content": "\u003e QUOTE (Sonny @ Mar 27 2009, 01:04 PM) An easy way to format/partition the USB, instead of the filter drivers\n\u003e Really it\u0027s not so simple.\nonline, I beg to differ.  \n\nBut let me explain that I mean the partitioning itself can be done with gParted (before or after installing grub). Rather than altering your installed OS with a third party driver.  \nNote gParted does not bother the mbr, I have tested this on a working bootable usb. I even messed up and had to move the first partition twice, after which it still booted without any issues. Nor, does it affect files/directories as it is data losseless.  \n\nAlso by \u0027copying the files\u0027 I simply meant if you wished to place any files in the second partition (such as a second copy of PE) you could do so from within Puppy Linux aswell. Since using this method to partition will not allow access to it thru windows.  \n\nI just thought that this might be an easy way for him to get the usb partitioned since he was having trouble with the filter driver, not that you should alter the howto or anything (great job btw Thanks).  \n\nI have tried both drivers myself but still prefer to reboot from cd over installing and then uninstalling these.  \n\nSonny   \n"

      "content": "\u003e I used microdrive\nMany thanks, now we know that Hitachi Microdrive seems more compatible compared to dummydisk (really I\u0027m not too surprised by that).  \nSo if you do not plane to buid your UFD with a Full XP then Microdrive seems a better choice.  \nAt least in this thread, it has just become the preferred, and then the **official** Filter Driver! ![:good:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/good.gif) ![^_^](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/happy.png)  \n\nIn my opinion, \"dummydisk\" is a bit less stable, but with the GREAT feature to install/filter ON-THE-FLY every new UFD without any user-input.  \nIt\u0027s enough to *handle* it with a little care and it pays you with a really great job, especially in some circumstances. ![^_^](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/happy.png)  \n\n\u003e Rather than altering your installed OS with a third party driver.\nReally it seems no matter, in my opinion (since you have to use a filter driver for a *noble* reason, and AFAIK without simpler alternatives, not for sport ![^_^](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/happy.png)).  \nIf you do not like to let some traces of any software in your Windows PC (and of course I generally agree) then you can download the freeware open-source \"ODIN - Open Disk Imager in a Nutshell\" - as an example - from here [http://odin-win.sourceforge.net/](http://odin-win.sourceforge.net/ \"External link\") , create an image-backup of your working partition before any undesirable software installation and then you can restore that image-backup on your now \"used\" partition.  \nAll in few minutes, and just what I do when needed. ![^_^](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/happy.png)  \nHowever \"dummydisk\" is easily uninstallable: it\u0027s enough to remove one registry key and one file and it will not \"disturb\" you more.  \nFurthermore \"dummydisk\" is needed (not optional) if you plane to build some finely working configurations on your UFD running a Full XP from.  \n\nHowever, I understand and partially agree your point of view, but can you see mine? ![^_^](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/happy.png)  \nHere the efforts are directed towards a broad compatibility and - as already mentioned - Disk Management console under Windows XP still seems the best choice (AFAIK).  \nEven if you have been able to boot from your machine your UFD just formatted by GParted it is not meaning that your UFD could boot from another machine, and probably it could not.  \nHere we are talking about an increased bootability, that\u0027s about a wide-compatibility and there are many reports out there, not only my experienced issues, that refer about XP\u0027s Disk Management Console related excellence when it creates the MBR of your disk (with the Partition Table inside).   \n"

[http://www.911cd.net...showtopic\u003d21850](http://www.911cd.net/forums//index.php?showtopic\u003d21850 \"External link\")  \n\nOn the other hands, with any USB stick larger than 512 MB (and without the removable-bit flipped, that\u0027s just as a USB removable device) and up to 32 GB (I\u0027ve tested every size up to 32 GB) any other procedure (HP Format Tool included) in order to make it bootable from my testing-machine had failed and any USB stick will not boot in ANY way except if it has more than 1 partition.  \n\nThis fact means that HP Format Tool is not really able to fool the BIOS of my testing-machine into believing that my USB stick is a Hard Disk, because then the BIOS of my testing-machine does NOT boot when a USB stick is formatted by HP Format Tool or prepared in any other procedure.  \n\nInstead, the same BIOS perfectly boots a USB stick of every size when I create more than 1 partition on it.  \n\nPlease, do your own conclusions.  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nEvery your further report will be more than welcome!   \n"

Again on d865glc intel mb.\nReally the \"Format-it-\\\u0026-Boot-it\" way (with the first FAT partition) is a bit more articulated: I created this way basing on the theory of many reports that refer as a first FAT partition seemed more compatible at booting and I suggest it only for particular employments (please, see in my signature about \"Multiple XP on Multi-Partitioned UFD\", just as an example).  \n\nSince actually I think that really the first FAT partition is not more matter because it referred to old experiences with a single partition and that in my opinion are actually outdated by the dual-partitioning (that\u0027s by the \"Format-it-\\\u0026-Forget-it\" way), if you want to use a Multiple environment then the first partition could be a FAT32 too.  \nSo in my opinion the \"**Format-it-\\\u0026-Forget-it** \" way is surely preferable in the most other cases.  \n\nHowever, since a BSOD is Windows-related (and not strictly hardware-booting related) if in your case it is occurred then it means that your USB stick has already booted and that something has gone wrong after the booting (I do not use LiveXP and I do not know too well how it works).  \nSo it is not a compatibility issue, because the USB stick has really booted (just because it is however dual-partitioned :smile:).  \nWith a more detailed issue we also could solve it.  \n\nThank you very much for your kind report about \"Format-it-\\\u0026-Boot-it\" way too. :smile:   \n"

But BIOS will experience the presence of a second partition, and this might make the difference for booting from the USB-stick. We have to wait for **online** or someone else to confirm if there is the desired effect on bootability.  \n\nThe nice thing of the Format Stick routine is that it can create the second partition automatically in one step without the need to install a filter driver.  \n\nBTW on April 24th a new version of the program was given to remove bug ERROR - Invalid FileSystem popup on pressing GO Button, which would occur for FAT and FAT32 sticks.  \nThis bug has however nothing to do with the new Format Stick routine.

Run grubinst on the stick.\n\nyup.  \n\n\u003e 6. Copy the first 16 sectors with HDhacker to a file.  \n\u003e\n\u003e 7. Add the grldr and whatever files you used before and try booting from the stick on the pesky machine\n\nSo I can only follow instructions without some error for so long, I copied the grub files before backing up the sectors. I know, I know. I have to live with it though so be gentle. ![:D](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/biggrin.png)  \n\nAnd it works, boots grub4dos on both machines. Thanks again for your help, can\u0027t wait to hear what you think of the experiment. Oh, almost forgot, I didn\u0027t have to change the sector count to balance it, it was balanced when I ran beeblebrox the second time.

Start from clean  \n2. Write \"standard\" MBR **CODE**   \n3. Write MBR **DATA** (which includes setting active the partition and creating a partition entry)  \n4. Format the partition  \n5. Replace the 1 sector \"default\" MBR **CODE** with grub4dos multi-sector one  \n\nWhat happened:  \n1. Start from clean OK  \n2. Write \"standard\" MBR **CODE** OK   \n3. Write MBR **DATA** (which includes setting active the partition and creating a partition entry) Not OK  \n4. Format the partition Not OK (but somehow worked by creating the parition and formatting it, so OK)  \n5. Replace the 1 sector \"default\" MBR **CODE** with grub4dos multi-sector one OK  \n\nMissing steps (that we will, in an apparently totally illogical manner :wink:, number from 9.) :  \n9. Set the partition Active  \n10. Assign or generate a unique Disk Signature (optional - but needed for some setups )  \n\nOnly practical differences from your original posted MBR:  \ngrub4dos format with hp util fat install grub4dos works on 915m5.dat  \nand from BOTH the files resulting from your \"redundant\" set of steps:  \n\n* 2_installed_grub4dos_mbr.dat\n* 5_hdhacker_write_step2_mbr_back.dat\n\nare the said ones:  \n\n* different (now correct) CHS/LBA balancing\n* Partition not made active (to be fixed)\n* Missing Disk Signature (to be fixed or automatically fixed at first occasion)\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nThis should mean that your motherboard is \"not sensible\" to balanced CHS/LBA.  \n\n![:D](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/biggrin.png)  \n\njaclaz   \n"

(of course i changed the bootorder to usb-first).  \nReason:  \nThis laptop (Asus A3H, AMI Bios) has a SECOND bootorder menu just for HD\u0027s.  \nSolution:  \n-connect stick, power up laptop, enter bios.   \n-Now the bios thinks there are two HD\u0027s, each HD is listed with its model name:  \n1. \"normal HD, brand, type\"  \n2. \"usbstick, brand, type\"  \nso the HD bootorder in this secondary menu has also to be changed to usbstick-first.  \n\n-now the laptop boots all sticks.  \n\nNOTE: with my stupid laptop, this procedure has to be done for any new stick, as the bios goes by the model of the stick. (unless all my sticks would be the same model).  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nSidenote:  \nI have one older stick which boots always on anything without any problems, even  \non this laptop. This stick is 512MB, shows as HD, its partition table is totaly corrupted (4 bogus partitions), but windows and linux think it has a Fat16 partition which can be read and written to. It therefore works fine. Maybe at one day i figure out why it works.   \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\ncheers  \n\na uninvited Guest.   \n"
