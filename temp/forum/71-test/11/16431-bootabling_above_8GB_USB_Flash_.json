If so then your BIOS is at fault.  \nNext test your USB 16GB drive using RMPrepUSB - Quick Size Test (destroys all data but is quick) - or H2TESTW - which is much slower but doesn\u0027t test used portions.  \n\npls report back here...   \n"

Then choose the menu entry to boot to your linux.  \nSee [here](https://sites.google.com/a/rmprepusb.com/www/tutorials/plop \"External link\")for details - there is a section on how to autorun Plop (though Plop does not always work on some systems so I don\u0027t recommend that).  \n\nOR make sure the linux files are in the FIRST 8GB of the 16GB USB pen.   \n"
