      "content": "I have come across a number of discussions related to flipping the removable bit of USB Flash Drives.  \n\nI found some reasons why a user would want to flip the removable bit.Are there any more advantages of flipping the RMB?\n\n* **Partition the USB Flash drive and access the various partitions simultaneously.** (Without flipping the bit , a UFD can be partitioned,but all partitons cannot be accessed simultaneoulsy.They can be accessed one by one using [USB_Part_Flip.exe](http://reboot.pro/14908/ \"\") or [Bootice](http://agnipulse.com/2011/11/partition-usb-flash-drive/ \"External link\").)\n* **Write Protect your USB Flash Drive** - \u003chttp://reboot.pro/13899/\u003e .The write protection works only for Fixed disks and not for removable media like UFDs.\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nThe above benefits can be achieved **without** flipping the RMB by using a filter driver like dummydisk.sys or cfadisk.sys.  \n\nSo why would a user want to flip the removable bit?  \nAre there any more benefits of flipping the Removable Bit?   \n"
