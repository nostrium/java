      "content": "I assume you\u0027re installing Windows 7 via pwboot\u0027s install option e.g. installing direct to USB drive; I have had issues with this myself. The easiest way I\u0027ve been able to successfully \u0027install\u0027 Windows 7 to USB is by creating a backup image from a host and restoring that image (untouched) to an external drive. This works every time, regardless of Windows version or architecture (SP0-1, 32-64bit); there\u0027s no opening of enclosures or switching cables and the patching can be done on host or USB. If this is an option for you I can give more details.  \n\nThe other option that works is to remove the drive from the USB case and connect it as an internal drive in your host machine; install Windows 7 normally (confirm working) and return it to the external case. Again, you can patch it internally or externally, it makes no difference.   \n"
