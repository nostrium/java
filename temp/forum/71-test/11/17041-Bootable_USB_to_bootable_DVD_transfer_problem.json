It works on VM Player so I assume it would most likely work on real machines (I am waiting to complete everything before I start using it with real machines).  \n\nThen I tried to transfer all of these to a multiboot DVD. It seems that rescue part works but I got problems with Win installations, especially with XP. I have to ask someone of you to try to translate these grub4dos commands from USB to DVD booting:  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\ntitle First part of Windows XP Professional setup  \nroot (hd0,0)  \nchainloader (hd0,0)/$WIN_NT$.\\~BT/SETUPLDR.BIN  \nsavedefault 1  \n\ntitle Second part of Windows XP Professional setup  \nroot (hd0,0)  \nchainloader (hd0,0)/NTLDR  \nsavedefault  \n\nI tried everything I could figure but it just doesn\u0027t work.   \n\nCheers!   \n"

Now I made it with the help of this tutorial (new multiboot DVD, not USB clone) but there is one problem:  \n\nThere\u0027s no mention of two step XP setup so I assume it is taken care of somehow but I can\u0027t see how. Two step seems to be possible but now I am interested whether it is possible to have just one step setup considering that no one complained about that in the comments.   \n"

Anyway, it seems that I am pretty close to make it and just need to clarify few more things to save me some effort before I continue. I have just exhausted my abilities to understand the subject.  \n\nSo, can you tell me whether the first part copies ntldr to HDD so it would be enough to have a menu option \"boot from HDD\" instead of Run 2nd part of setup? Of course it means the fresh installation of XP.  \n\nNow I got it made, at least for XP and 7, with BOOTMGR but I would like to have it with GRLDR (better menus, loading ISO files...).  \n\nIt also seems that it\u0027s possible to call grldr from bootmgr but there\u0027s a problem with XP again. Is it possible to make separate BOOTMGR and boot/bcd files for 7 (leave it intact) and for XP move them within XP folder?  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nWhat I want is:  \n\nRun XP setup  \nRun 7 setup  \n\nRun Active Boot Disk  \nRun Hiren\u0027s  \n\nReboot  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nThanks a bunch!   \n"
