      "content": "I was wondering and you guys could help me make a clear view on all existing usb flash disks on the market.  \n\nSo, what are the usb flash disk you have used and you use nowadays for booting different tools? Ideally, state clearly which one worked best and why do you think so.  \nSo, basically, this is what I want to find out also for the flash devices you have tested:  \n\nManufacturer:  \nModel:  \nCapacity:  \nRead speed:  \nWrite speed:  \n{Optional: Flippable bit } // Maybe ... ( or forget about this! )  \nMulti partitioning: (?) \\^\\^\\^  \n\nWhat you use it to boot or install for? Linux, Windows, PEs ... How it performed ... Lke a short review  \n\nAnd if you would want to buy one for booting PEs, linux, installing windows, which one you would have opt for? Kingston, Lexar, Kingmax, HP and many more ?  \n\nThanks!   \n"

      "content": "The only one I would **not** recommend is Patriot Rage 32GB Flash drive - many systems seem to have intermittent problems booting from this key (at least my one). Often the system will completely freeze during POST until the Patriot is removed and then will halt again if it is re-inserted! On some systems the keyboard won\u0027t work after booting from this key. I have not had any such problems with any other of my keys.  \n\nFor a recommendation, I would recommend a Lexar Jumpdrive (or similar) because BootIt,exe will flip the bit on these. This can be useful for some systems which don\u0027t boot from a removable drive.  \nFor any other I would strongly suggest a USB 3 flash drive - these are faster than most USB 2 drives when connected to a USB **2** port and so are worth it even if you don\u0027t have a system with USB 3 ports (yet).  \n\nUSB 3 drives I have are a BUSBI 16GB and a Pretec 8GB.- I have not had any trouble from these so far and they are pretty fast too.   \n"
