      "content": "Hello,  \n\nMy tiny USB stick booted happily from SARDU until it got corrupted (filesystem RAW, 0 bytes capacity, etc). I FAT32 formatted it, and re-installed my distros, but now it won\u0027t boot. I plug it in, and all the computer says is \"Boot error.\" This happens on every Windows XP machine (different BIOSes) I have tried it on. In fact, my friend experienced the same problem: the USB just isn\u0027t bootable (at least on Windows XP) after a format. I tried searching, but no dice. Does anyone know why this happens, or how I can fix it? A deeper format? A different format?  \n\nTIA   \n"

It is very good for information around different (windows) systems.  \n\n[http://www.rmprepusb.com/](http://www.rmprepusb.com/ \"External link\")  \n\nWhen you use SARDU you have to format the stick in \"fat32\".   \n"
