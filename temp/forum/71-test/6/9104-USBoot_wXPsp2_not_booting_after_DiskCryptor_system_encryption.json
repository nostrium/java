      "content": "Im having a really hard time getting a working encrypted system USB drive to boot on my new notebook (Intel Centrino Duo with ICH9 Chipset and Controllers)  \n\nas mentioned in this thread:  \n[http://www.boot-land...?showtopic\u003d8802](http://www.boot-land.net/forums/index.php?showtopic\u003d8802 \"External link\")  \nthanks again to Jaclaz for lots of help here.  \n\nI have successfully booted several USB devices in this notebook with USBoot prepaired XPsp2 in various configurations but it fails to boot after any type system encryption on USB drives but after the encryption these USB devices do successfully boot in my desktop PC (AMD Athelon)   \n\nsystem encryption successfully boots in this notebook from the internal HDD but not from USB drives allthough the USB drives also boot successfully in it without the encryption  \n\nI have tried so far with TrueCrypt, DriveCrypt Plus, and DiskCryptor.  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nwith TrueCrypt and DriveCrypt on the USBoot prepaired USB device it only gets only as far as a blinking cursor after entering the password.   \n\nwith DiskCryptor it gets much father along, all the way to the point just after initializing \"ArcGuard\" just before disk checking. it seems to fail at the start of the disk check but I cant say for certain.  \n\nfails with BSOD Stop Code \"UNMOUNTABLE_BOOT_VOLUME\"  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nJaclaz, I would like your help starting from scratch again if you are still willing to guide me through your proccess of elimintation for tracking down this problem.  \n\nunlike the other system encryption software DiskCryptor does not offer a Pre Boot Authentication test so I must encrypt first. this is not good for experimenting since it takes some time so I would like to test with a 40GB USB HDD except only using 8GB of the drive. would that be reasonable or should I use the full amount? I ask first because the full amount would add hours to each retry due to the lack of pre test in DiskCryptor.  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nin my previous attempts I have been starting with a fresh install of XPsp2 with only chipset and memory drivers added then prepping with USBoot with no options. the documentation of USBoot is also severely lacking as to what each steps alternats do.  \n\nIm not opposed to leaning a manual way to prepair OS for USB booting but I dont have alot of time to spare and especially for experiments that may or may not succeed. the USBoot method does work in this notebook without encryption and with encryption in my desktop. if I can figure out how to skip its disk checking phase that might be the issue (just thinking aloud, obviously I have no clue)  \n\nif anyone here has any insight into what it might possibly be causing the BSOD in this case then Please post your ideas or suggestions. I really need this to work.  \n\nthanks   \n"

      "content": "From what you report, it seems to me that:  \nthe device is partitioned/formatted in such a way that (without encryption):  \n\n* it works on the desktop\n* it works on the laptop\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nand, as soon as the BOOT CODE (in either the MBR or PBR, or BOTH) is changed to one of the Truecrypt, DriveCrypt Plus, or DiskCryptor ones:  \n\n* it continues working on desktop\n* it STOPS working on the laptop\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nThus the problem must be in some incompatibilities between the laptop BIOS and the \"encrypt apps\" BOOT CODE.  \n\nOr in other words, it is possible that the setup is in some way NOT \"kosher\", and while the Desktop BIOS \"accept\" this, being of \"largish view\", the laptop BIOS refuses to, being a little, provincial, narrow minded BIOS. ![:(](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/sad.png)  \n\nThe only possibilty we (actually you ![:unsure:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/unsure.png)) have is to try and create a \"very compatible\" partitioning/format of the stick/disk and hope that it will be enough to overcome the problem, since the BIOS CANNOT be touched/hacked and, as well, whilst doable, the procedure of patching/hacking the BOOT CODE is beyond the scope 8and even if succesful may provoke a reversion, i.e. succeeding in booting on the laptop but failing to do so on the desktop. ![:unsure:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/unsure.png)  \n\nOf the three behaviours you described, the DiskCryptor actually seems the most \"promising\", since the STOP error comes from a Windows file, so that the problem might derive from somethng to be corrected \"at a higher level or merely at the drive addresses. ![:(](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/sad.png)  \n\n:wink:  \n\njaclaz   \n"

I havnt tried it, just making a note for myself.  \n\nit also seems that the Intel ICH family chipsets comes up in more cases than not when searching for USB boot errors involving \"UNMOUNTABLE_BOOT_VOLUME\"   \n\nmight be worth mentioning.   \n"
