But now, I can\u0027t remember what is the barrier for grub2 to go for prime time.   \n\nThanks   \n"

      "content": "***WHEN*** there will be an official release, ***THEN*** it may be \"prime-time\".  \n\nRight now there are bits and pieces, no official pre-compiled binary, lots of ideas, but nothing actually easily testable.  \n\nI, for one, will wait for it, I am not going to risk the time needed to setup a proper environment to build from source code without knowing if the result will work (and WHY, i.e. because I failed in the compiling).  \n\nI think we have seen that the fast and good ![:lol:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/laugh.png) past and present development of grub4dos is due to several factors, beside the capabilities and dedication of the developers, that allowed to widen the interested audience:  \n\n* availability of pre-compiled builds and nightbuilds\n* dedicated support forum\n* examples and documentation/guides\n* attitude of developers to listen to users suggestions\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nI find the above to have been key factors, that I find completely missing in the grub2 project.  \n\nSee this for an example:  \n[http://www.boot-land...?...c\u003d5275\\\u0026st\u003d5](http://www.boot-land.net/forums/index.php?showtopic\u003d5275\u0026st\u003d5 \"External link\")  \n\nHas the situation changed lately from your knowledge? :wink:  \n\n:wink:  \n\njaclaz   \n"
