What OS are you trying to boot?  \n2. Which commands did you use for fbinst exactly  \n3. Did you use grub or any other type of bootloader  \n4. What size were the USB drives  \n5. What mainboard and BIOS?  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nMany old boards will boot if you have a 512mb or lower USB stick and use ZIP FAT16 CHS in RMPrepUSB - did you try this?  \n\nThanks  \nSteve   \n"

      "content": "\u003e This mainboard in this computer is such stupid that in windows it is working like usb 2.0 but in usb boot is usb 1.1\nYou can try to increase in this case the boot speed by letting PLoP BootManager preload USB 2.0 driver.  \nThis option is available in GRUB4DOS Menu on USB-sticks prepared with Make_USB.exe ![:whistling:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/happy22.gif)   \n\n[http://www.msfn.org/...ooting-with-pe/](http://www.msfn.org/board/topic/121446-install-from-usb-after-booting-with-pe/ \"External link\")  \n\nThe size of pe3.iso may be cannot be decreased that much. ![:huh:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/huh.png)   \n\nBTW much faster booting is available when you install pe3.iso as GRUB4DOS boot option on HDD e.g. your C: drive.  \nYou can boot in 30 sec with pe3.iso loaded by GRUB4DOS from HDD and booting then from RAMDISK X:  \nThat is by far the best way to boot.   \nSince you boot from RAMDISK, you are allowed to do everything you want (including format or restore of ghost image)   \nand make the desired changes in your C: drive from which you just launched pe3.iso :wink:   \n\nOnly in case the harddisk is brandnew or damaged, then it can be necessary to boot from USB-stick.   \n"

      "content": "Thanks for the reply - Grub does not like the \u0027Force use of LBA calls\u0027 RMPrepUSB option as this makes a \u0027bad\u0027 partition table which Grub warns you about. Please untick the \u0027Force use of LBA calls\u0027 option and it should work OK.  \n\nI will add the --skip-mbr-test to the command in the next version which will avoid this error message.   \n"
