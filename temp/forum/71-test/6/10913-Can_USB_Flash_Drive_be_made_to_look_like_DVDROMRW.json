Because there have been times were the system files have been corrupted (by virus, bad updates, etc.) and all that is needed is a simple repair - but - sometimes the Laptop/PC/Netbook/whatever... does not have a working CD/DVD. Also, the process is faster when run from a USB Flash Drive (and one can store and update files on FD).  \n\nI have tried other methods... see my posts:  \n[http://www.boot-land...?...6800\\\u0026st\u003d60#](http://www.boot-land.net/forums/index.php?showtopic\u003d6800\u0026st\u003d60# \"External link\")  \n[http://www.boot-land...?...pid\u003d96360](http://www.boot-land.net/forums/index.php?showtopic\u003d7739\u0026st\u003d220\u0026gopid\u003d96360\u0026# \"External link\")  \n\nI hope I\u0027ve made sense :smile: and maybe someone could help me figure this out.  \nYes I am a \u0027newbie\u0027 - but - I really want to learn...   \n"

Hopefully I\u0027ll keep learning...  \nSpeaking of NTLDR and Boot.ini ... is there some resource I can look to that will give me some insight into what needs to be modified in the boot files to get the UFD to boot compatible volume for running XP? Or maybe I should start a new topic?  \n\n\u003e ...The FreeDos message in this particular case seems to me allright, as you used a \"wrong\" geometry.  \n\u003e 0/1/1 means LBA 32 on a m/n/32 geometry which becomes 0/0/33 on a m/n/63 geometry as probably the USB stick \"declares\" itself.\n\nThat\u0027s way over my head right now... but this too I will try to learn...eventually...   \n"

Just partition your pen as you did before with RMPrepUSB and then use the FiletoUSB function to copy the FIRST SECTOR ONLY of a MBR_xPTN.BIN file to the USB pen and then try it.\nHello Steve,  \nI would like to figure this out - but - I have done so many variations of preparing the UFD that I think it would be good to start with a clean slate...Before I used this:  \n[![RMP.gif](http://reboot.pro/uploads/monthly_04_2010/post-35020-1270425572_thumb.png)](http://reboot.pro/uploads/monthly_04_2010/post-35020-1270425572.gif \"RMP.gif - Size: 22.69KB\"){#ipb-attach-url-10808-0-93834500-1676066665}   \nDo you still want me to use MBR_1PTN? or untick the (C: 2PTNS) option?  \nI did read the TESTMBR readme.txt and there seems to be a contradiction (at least to me).   \nJust so you know, I did follow the readme.txt and here are the results:  \n\nMBR_0PTN  \nDL\u003d80h  \nMBR\u003d0000:7C00  \nL3F  \nHDD0  \nS20  \nHDD-ZIP0  \n\\*my note - the above screen had a blinking cursor after ZIP0, no text as stated in readme.txt. When I booted back to my XP, Windows Explorer and tried to access the drive I got the message: Insert disk in K:  \n\nMBR_1PTN  \nDL\u003d80h  \nMBR\u003d0000:7C00  \nL3F  \nHDD0  \nS20  \nHDD-ZIP0  \n\\*my note - the above screen had a blinking cursor after ZIP0, no text as stated in readme.txt. When I booted back to my XP, Windows Explorer and tried to access the drive I got the message: K: not formatted, format now? Format Fat32 showed size 3.79  \n\nMBR_2PTN  \nDL\u003d80h  \nMBR\u003d0000:7C00  \nL3F  \nHDD0  \nS20  \nHDD-ZIP0  \n\\*my note - the above screen had a blinking cursor after ZIP0, no text as stated in readme.txt. When I booted back to my XP, Windows Explorer and tried to access the drive I got the message: K: not formatted, format now? Format Fat32 showed size 3.79  \n\nUnder the MBR_2PTN I did format the UFD and rebooted. Now I got:  \nDL\u003d80h  \nMBR\u003d0000:7C00  \nL06  \nHDD0  \nS20  \nHDD-ZIP0  \n\\*my note - the above screen had a blinking cursor after ZIP0, not other text.  \n\nSo, how do you want to proceed?  \n\nP.S, I think I know why the Install Grub may not be working (at least for me). But maybe you want to ![:whistling:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/happy22.gif) this first ![:blowup:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/blowup.gif)   \nI did another UFD and now have one that boots to the Win7 Setup and one that boots to Vista Home Setup... both show the 14.9GB under Windows XP.   \n"

      "content": "Hi  \nSo you are saying that other UFDs work, but your original one doesn\u0027t??  \n\nDid you try the ForceLBA option? from the TESTMBR results, it looks like BIOS is using CHS where it has 32 sectors per track (20). If you use ForceLBA it may work.  \n\nWhen using TESTMBR in 236/237 then always use all of the file (not just one sector). Instructions have changed since v735.  \n\nP.S. it is expected to stop with flashing cursor as you found. The code is just a test stub and will not actually boot to any OS.   \n"
