      "content": "Several months ago I needed to help an elderly relative  \nwho has two old desktops. They\u0027re in good condition,  \nbecause I\u0027ve replaced 90% of the hardware in both  \nof them.  \n\nI\u0027ve got many portable diagnostic apps on bootable CDs  \nand USB sticks. Old desktops can\u0027t boot from either, but  \nPLoP came to the rescue. I used v5.0.3 and created a  \nsimple PLoP floppy. I selected CDROM or USB from the  \nmenu. It worked perfectly!  \n\nRecently, I got a call from the same relative, because he  \nneeded help again with his desktops. I didn\u0027t keep the  \noriginal PLoP floppy, so I created a new one in a few minutes.  \nFor some reason, PLoP keeps telling me all my bootable CDs  \nare not bootable. I downloaded the latest version - 5.0.8.  \nSame problem!  \n\nI\u0027m a command line junkie going back 30 years, so I have  \nno trouble performing simple or complex operations from  \nthe command line.  \n\nI posted on the PLoP forum. Elmar, the creator of PLoP  \ndoesn\u0027t have a solution.  \n\nI tested my bootable CDs on several modern desktops that  \nall have a seperate BIOS utility that allows you to boot from  \na wide range of devices. There is nothing wrong with any of  \nmy bootable CDs.  \n\nBoth old desktops have CDROM and CDRW drives. PLoP  \nidentifies them correctly, when you select CDROM from the  \nmenu.  \n\nElmar has made it incredibly easy to create a working floppy  \nwith PLoP.  \n\nI\u0027ve tried some crazy things, like creating the same floppy  \nwith different brands of disks. There is only one anomally  \nwhen I create a PLoP floppy. The starfield graphical theme  \ndoesn\u0027t work. The only thing I remember about the original  \nworking floppy is the starfield and the menu. I didn\u0027t use the  \n\"stf\" parameter with the working disk, but the starfield  \nappeared anyway. When I attempt to recreate the disk, the  \nstarfield doesn\u0027t appear, even if I use the \"stf\u003don\" parameter.  \nI don\u0027t care about the starfield one way or the other, but  \nmaybe the failure of the starfield is part of a larger problem  \nwhich is causing PLoP to list all bootable CDs as not bootable.  \n\nElmar was very kind. He tried to help, but all he could say  \nwas \"very strange.\" I agree with him!  \n\nThere is something wrong, but I\u0027m at a dead end. Before I  \nabandon PLoP, maybe a forum member can help me.   \n"

On the other  \nhand, it\u0027s common for advanced computer users  \nto understand all the inner workings of an app,  \nsometimes better than the person(s) who created  \nthe app.  \n\nWhen I attempted to recreate the PLoP floppy the  \nonly version I had was 5.0.3. I didn\u0027t bother checking  \nthe PLoP site to see if there were any newer versions.  \nThat\u0027s why I was really puzzled when it failed to work.  \nI used the same copy I had downloaded several months  \nago. Even though I didn\u0027t save the original disk, it was  \nso easy to create another I wasn\u0027t concerned about  \nhaving problems with the same version of PLoP. When  \nit failed to work, that\u0027s when I checked the PLoP site  \nand downloaded the latest version, 5.0.8.

I have an extensive background in  \nelectronics. It\u0027s no problem for me to replace anything  \nin these desktops. I\u0027ve got friends in the surplus business  \nwho always manage to find unused components for old  \ndesktops. It may seem like a thousand years ago, but in  \nthe early 1990\u0027s companies like Gateway had no idea  \nhow rapidly key components like processors and RAM  \nwould advance! They thought their desktops would be  \nused for 10 years, so they built them like army tanks.  \n\nBefore I move on to an app like SMART Boot Manager,  \nI\u0027d like to try one last thing. Yesterday, I was able to  \ndownload several different versions of PLoP. 5.0.3 - thru -  \n5.0.7. The problem is I can\u0027t find earlier versions of plpcfgbt.  \nThe only one available is the latest, plpcfgbt-0.7.zip. I need  \nversions 0.3 - thru - 0.6. You can\u0027t use the new version of  \nplpcfgbt with older versions of PLoP.  \n\nIt takes about 5 minutes to create a PLoP floppy.

      "content": "Hi, I am also versed in electronics and have been using computers for years.  \n\nCan we take a step back from PLoP for a minute?  \n\nI remember how unreliable floppy disks and drives were, and still are. In fact, you could create a floppy on one computer and bring it to another computer and it wouldn\u0027t read.  \n\nWhy? Misalignment of the floppy read/write heads. So let me ask you this... Did you create the floppy boot disk using the same drive you are trying to boot it with? If not, could you create a boot disk on your relative\u0027s computer, or install your floppy drive on his computer?  \n\nAnother solution I would suggest is ditching the whole boot from CD-ROM or USB method.  \n\nWhy not install a cheap small hard drive as the master IDE, install whatever OS your relative uses on the drive and whatever diagnostic and fix-it tools you need, then install his main drive after that as a slave, and use your \"rescue fixed disk\" to repair his computer? That way you have a sure way to boot, and you can diagnose hardware, work with his disk while it is offline, etc. When done, obviously revert it back to normal.  \n\nIt is a bit more work, you have to disassemble the PC, but it is a good excuse to blow out the dust inside, if any.  \n\nFinally, if this user of yours is having MS Windows related issues due to malware or viruses, and his needs are not specialized, I would suggest he try Linux instead. Depending on the distro it is super easy to use and has a full suite of apps and drivers ready to go. The distro to use depends on the power of the PC. Anyway, I use Linux Mint 7 XFCE which has a light weight but full featured desktop with familiar controls (compared to Windows), and it runs rock solid and detected all of my hardware and installed flash, etc out of the box. I don\u0027t have to defrag, virus scan, or any of that nonsense anymore. Boot times are fast also. It\u0027s not for everyone, just a suggestion.  \n\nbreaker   \n"
