Therefore you need a real PC style DOS like FreeDOS or MS-DOS. Of course it needs to be on a formatted partition it understands (FAT32 not NTFS). Once that is sorted, you can install the program EasyBCD (in Windows 7) to help you load DOS directly from the Windows 7 boot loader. NO you don\u0027t need a 3rd party boot manager in your MBR.   \n"
