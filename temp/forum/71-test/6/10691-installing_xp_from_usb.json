I am trying to install winxp on it for the first time.  \n\nDuring installation, i did something silly by removing the usb flash drive mistakenly, while the setup was formatting the hard drive.   \n\nI tried to re-start the installation but now i am getting an \"error loading operating system\" message.  \n\nPls can anyone help.   \n"
