Try it first, but if it gives you an error (usually something about a hal.dll file not loading) and doesn\u0027t continue booting into Windows XP, try the other options. (\"1ST TRY THIS\" aims for a Win XP installation to the first drive on the first partition, if yours is different, you will have to select another option. \"ninth\" aims for a Win98 installation on drive C, and \"tenth\" aims for a Win98 installation on drive D)\nOne of the choices should eventually boot you back into Windows. (If you go all the way to option 10 and still get errors on startup, try changing boot.ini to windows.ini and then winxp.ini to boot.ini, run through all 10 possibilities again, then change boot.ini to winxp.ini and winnt.ini to boot.ini and trying those 10 choices.
