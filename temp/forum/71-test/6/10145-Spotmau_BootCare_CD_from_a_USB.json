If I continuously surf the Internet I may be able to find CDs or software applications that do the same as yours does but for free! Why should I pay for it if I can get a free on?\".  \n\u003e\n\u003e **The answer can be very simple: Linux is a free operating system. But why most of us still prefer to pay for Microsoft Windows?**   \n\u003e\n\u003e **Actually no other utility CD can do the same as ours does. PowerSuite CD is the world #1 multitask CD. This CD can do much more than any other utility CD in the world.**  \n\u003e\n\u003e PowerSuite includes: Partition Genius™ ($49.95 value), Clone Genius ($49.99 value!), The Data Recovery ($49.99 value!), Windows Recovery™ ($29.95 value!) and so on.  \n\u003e\n\u003e It may take forever for you to find the \"CDs or software applications that do the same\" as ours does. Even if you have found some free software you may hesitate to use them since they may not have been fully tested yet by professionals. Furthermore, they are not so handy as our All-in-One CD.\n\nReally nice from people that till a few days/weeks ago used it as a base for their Commercial app. :smile:  \n\nAnd of course they do look like \"modest\" **W00T?** :wink:   \n"

It\u0027s completely useless as a LiveCD.. about 90% of the utilities won\u0027t work from Live environment and will only work from Windows.. I wouldn\u0027t even bother downloading it if they were giving it for free...  \n\nHave you tried other alternatives?   \n"
