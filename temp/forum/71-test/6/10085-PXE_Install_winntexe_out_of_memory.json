      "content": "Hi guys,  \n\nI\u0027m attempting to use Barts Network Disk to PXE my dying Vaio back to life (No CD/USB etc)  \n\nIts a PCG-GRT815e, 512mb RAM P4 2.8.  \n\nEverything was running smooth, so far I have managed to boot into the network environment, access the share, and use fdisk to erase all partitions. I created a new partition and did a full format. All good, I have a C: drive now.  \n\nThe tut I am following ([http://www.lockstock...xe-boot-windows](http://www.lockstockmods.net/2008/05/26/easy-way-to-pxe-boot-windows \"External link\")) says to run SMARTDRV which I\u0027ve done, then navigate to and execute winnt.  \n\nAs soon as I confirm that the path to i386 is correct, the installer tells me we\u0027re out of memory and can\u0027t continue.  \n\nI have tried running Barts disk with all of the options (EMM386 on or off) but no use. Anyone have any advice? I\u0027ve looked around quite a bit but can\u0027t seem to see anything.   \n\nThanks a bunch guys   \n"
