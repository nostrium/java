      "content": "Unfortunately, my PC\u0027s onboard SATA controller has become fried, rendering my computer nearly unusable. (I went through a lot to narrow down the problem to this cause.) I really can\u0027t afford to do anything about this, however, I do have a SATA hard drive dock with ESATA and USB connectors. The ESATA works slightly better than the internal SATA, but I still experience plenty of problems. However, since my external USB HDD works just fine, I\u0027d like to boot from the same drive in USB mode instead. When attempting this, I get a BSOD with STOP 7B during boot. I have tried both PWBoot and USBBootWatcher, but I still got the same STOP 7B after installing each one. Since I don\u0027t really know what I\u0027m doing here, I\u0027m asking for help getting it to boot.   \n"

Take a quick look at:  \n[http://www.boot-land...?showtopic\u003d9196](http://www.boot-land.net/forums/index.php?showtopic\u003d9196 \"External link\")  \n\nSome steps in the tutorial are not necessary in your case.  \nFollowing are the steps as I can see:  \n\n1- boot Windows 7 with your HDD as eSATA.  \n2- be sure to have administrator rights. Excute the two batch files in this order :  \n- usbbootfix.bat  \n- StorageBootStart.bat   \n(the above two batch files should be downloaded and stored in a separate directory).  \n3- shutdown Windows 7.  \n4- reboot Windows 7 with your HDD as USB2.   \n"
