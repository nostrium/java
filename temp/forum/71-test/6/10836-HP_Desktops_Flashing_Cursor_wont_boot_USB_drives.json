      "content": "I\u0027ve been working with VistaPE and now Win7Rescue for a year or two. I started off working with Dells and they have always performed great with bootable USB images. Recently we\u0027ve made the switch to HP desktops and now all my USB boot images don\u0027t boot. HP simply has a flashing cursor and won\u0027t do anything else. I tried searching the forums but didn\u0027t find much. Surely people must have run into this before? If burn the .iso output from winbuilder to a disk and boot the HP, it works fine. It seems like it\u0027s something with the disk formatting or grub4dos. Please if anyone can lend some advice, it would be very much appreciated.   \n"

      "content": "Well, I tried asking three questions, numbered from 1 to 3, why it is so difficult to have three answers, numbered as well from 1 to 3? :smile:  \n\nHowever, if the device(s) are external USB Hard Disk drives there is NO NEED whatsoever for any of the \"special\" utilities, XP Disk Management can partition and format them allright, as these devices are seen as \"Fixed\".  \n\nSame goes for Vista and Windows 7 (which can also partition and format \"Removable\" devices) BUT you may need to adjust the Registry to use the \"old\" convention on boundaries.  \n\nAs a retaliation for not having answered my questions I\u0027ll omit a link to the Registry fix, which I am sure you can find anyway.  \n\nIf you have used in the past either the HP USB Format Utility or PEtoUSB on external hard disks, it was perfectly unneeded, particularly being PEtoUSB limited by design to FAT16 it should have posed a serious limitation to the use of external HD. :smile:  \n\nThen, you may want to check if **for the specific** motherboards you have, there are similar reports, and check if an updated BIOS was issued to resolve this kind of problems.  \n\nI would like to congratulate with **Randy Dale** :smile: for having used his first post on the Board making a likely candidate for the 2010 award for \"The most generic and unreferenced/unbacked up suggestion\". :smile:  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n:smile:  \nWonko   \n"
