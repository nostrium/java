That\u0027s why many laws overtime become unenforceable, i.e. de-facto stayed. Because they no longer reflect current interests of power brokers. More, some laws historically led their main enforcers to a Guillotine just a few years down the road, so remote they were to true Justice as perceived by the majority. That\u0027s also why most religions claim to establish Fair Rules and Proper Conduct baselines, not recognizing it being fully reflected in today\u0027s law whatever it is, because they address society as a whole, its every individual regardless of what social group s/he belongs to, which may not be the factual case with law and its enforcement in some countries.  \n\n![Posted Image](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/Guillotinemodels.jpg/220px-Guillotinemodels.jpg)   \n"
