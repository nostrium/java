      "content": "I know of some tools that can perform drive copying by using sector-to-sector method, but I was wondering what people would recommend to copy a USB Stick to multiple USB sticks?  \n\nExample: You\u0027ve now just finished configuring the ultimate bootable usb stick that\u0027s got everything you want and need. It\u0027s got a cool boot menu using Grub4Dos with all your bits and pieces. You now want to make 10 or more copies of that stick, without having to run the \"Copy-To-Usb\" script in WinBuilder.  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nWhat would people recommend?   \n"
