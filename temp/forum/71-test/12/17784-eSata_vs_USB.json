      "content": "Hello Forum Experts,  \n\nI have a ISO that was made with Winbuilder. I have it booting from a external Hard drive that supports Esata and USB 2.0. It\u0027s able to boot fine when connected to the eSata port. However, when I try to boot it using the USB ports on my laptop I get the dreaded \"stop 7B BSOD\". I tried updating the Sata drivers but I still get the same 7B BSOD. Weird how it boots fine from eSata but not from USB. Has anybody ran into this problem before?  \n\nThanks!   \n"

Has anybody ran into this problem before?  \nIt\u0027s not weird at all. **Microsoft Windows** will use **SATA** drivers for SATA and **USB** drivers for USB. Updating SATA drivers will not affect your results if you are booting from USB. I\u0027d suggest creating **CriticalDeviceDatabase** entries for your USB hardware and finding out what USB drivers you need.  \n\nAlso, please specify what you are building with **WinBuilder** , including project name and operating system version.   \n"
