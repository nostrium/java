      "content": "This is probably very simple to fix but I have spent several hours trying to solve my problem but can\u0027t.\n\nHope someone can help please.\n\nI have used SARDU to make a multiboot ISO to burn to DVD. I have added some extra progs to the menu and the final build works fine from QEMU. However, I wanted to customise the menu for personal easier navigation. So I extracted all files and folders from the ISO and then updated the isolinux.cfg menu file. Then I used IMGBURN to re-make the ISO but the ISO isn\u0027t bootable either in QEMU of from a DVD. I understand that in IMGBURN there is an advanced tab in the ISO build mode and under the advanced tab there is an option to make a bootable ISO but I just don\u0027t understand if this is what I must use.\n\nThere is nothing incorrect with my updated isolinux.cfg file as I have checked that it works by using the same changes with the syslinux.cfg file from a USB build.\n\n"

I followed your instrctions and my customised ISO now works. Thank you very much. I spent about two hours looking through the IMGBURN guides and didn\u0027t come across the instruction you have provided in a clear and succinct manner. I did try to figure this out for myself until I realised I wasn\u0027t going to be able to climb over the brick wall that I\u0027d hit.\n\n"
