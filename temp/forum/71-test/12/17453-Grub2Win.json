      "content": "Hi, drummerdp here. I recently set up a project on sourceforge called grub2win. Grub2win lets you boot the officially released GNU grub 2.00 from Windows 7, Windows 8 or Vista. Grub2 supports extremely large drives and GPT partitions.  \n\nThis gets around the old 4 partition MBR limit. I currently have 7 Linux partitions on one GPT disk as well as Mac and Windows partitions.  \n\nAdvanced scripting, searches and many other functions are available at boot time. All commonly used file systems for Windows, Linux and Mac are supported.  \n\nInstallation is simple and takes only seconds. The software requires only one small directory on the C: drive, less than 5 MB.  \n\nGrub2win uses the Windows bootmgr / bcd to boot grub from a normal NTFS directory on the C: drive.  \nThe native Windows MBR is not touched. This makes multi-booting much less risky.  \n\nThere is an alternative download available for XP / 2000 users.  \n\nNote: This project was previously called grub24dos. It has over 11,000 users worldwide.  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nGive it a try and let me know how you make out. The code can be found here:  \n\n[https://sourceforge/projects/grub2win](https://sourceforge/projects/grub2win \"External link\")  \n\nThanks.  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n"
