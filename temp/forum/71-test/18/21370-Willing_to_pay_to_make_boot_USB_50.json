      "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI\u0027m willing to pay to make a specific USB with easy2boot. Ive been struggling to make this usb for a month and I am tech savvy, but I always get errors and post them here. It seems like every time I post the error it takes alot of time, and the people here help me get past one error, only to go back and encounter a new one. And then you guys suggest something else and something else. And quite frankly, I need this done. Its not something I can spend months on going back and fourth on a forum and asking questions. I want to learn, but I also am stricken by time. I figure I can learn over teamviewer.  \n\nI am not just stricken by time but I am also personally annoyed at all the back and fourth I have to do to make a bootable usb, because its always been easy for me, until It came to trying to put multiple ISO\u0027s on one usb and selecting the RIGHT options one right after the other, trying to see it on QEMU. Then when Ive read tutorials on a specific PE that I want to put on the USB, its so much information to use programs to make the ISO compatible etc. Its just so much work and I\u0027m so confused and lost.  \n\nIn other words Ive determined its too difficult to try on my own, and I am very much of the philosophy that I prefer to learn something then to have someone else do it. When you cant learn it on your own, then you need to learn where and how to get help, and so Ive resorted to posting on this forum, and its been very time consuming and frustrating.\n\nSo if any of you are willing to help me, please respond.\n\n"

If you\u0027re not willing to put in the effort, then it will never happen. It will take time, you\u0027ll make mistakes, and you\u0027ll need to be patient as you learn what works and what doesn\u0027t.\n\nThere are plenty of people here that are equally as busy as you are, we can\u0027t take time out of our busy lives for this. If you ask me, you\u0027re just lazy.\n\nSo.....get to work.\n\n"

      "content": "Well let me show you how lazy I am. I went and bought the Sardu program and spent about a week thinking a paid program was the ultimate solution and trying to figure out if it worked on what I needed it for. Then I googled and youtube how to do it. Next, I found out the Windows PE I was trying to use wasnt compatible with Sardu. I emailed the support team for it, and they were not helpful. I found out on this forum that xboot was obsolete (another software I spent an absurd amout of time thinking was compatible) with the Windows PE I was using, though it worked well with Antivirus ISO\u0027s. Next I saw that Rufus worked well, but rufus will only do one Iso per USB. I messaged the maker and he said he would NOT allow RUfus to make multiple ISOs. We went back and fourth several emails. I came here and people assisted me with xboot. Finally after all the assistance and getting down to the final problem, someone said \"Oh the xboot maker died in a car accident, so go try something else.\n\nI tried YUMI, but it didnt do what I needed it to. There was other programs that offered to put programs of your choice or preselected ISO\u0027s onto a usb. This was not what I was looking for. I needed ISO\u0027s and a windows PE on a USB.\n\nSo then I go and download RMprep. Rmprep by default, it only allows one iso (If RMprep is all you have). So I messaged the maker of RMprep and asked if he would code it to make multiple ISO\u0027s and that I would be willing to donate to help make this possible. He told me that I was looking for easy2boot. So I download easy2boot, and at this point, I am relieved. Because Ive successfully burned ISO\u0027s many times, and I saw a video on youtube on how to do it with easy2boot. I see that it looks well organized. I read what I could, and began attempting. I fail, post on here and take screenshot of all the problems I have. Of course, this forum helped me solve it. I repeat this a few times, and its another error and another and another and another, and I cant even get the qemu to work. I test it normally without the Qemu, and it still doesn\u0027t work.\n\nAt one point I get a black cmd window that tells me to pull out the flash drive. So I do and my computer goes blank. I restart it and I try microsofts tools to repair the pc. I tried various tools, such as windows system restore, I tried entering commands on the cmd window, sfc Scannow. I try other commands given to me from people on youtube who said these specific commands fixed the problem I had with the error message I had.\n\nThe problem was that as they solved it on their pc, the commands only went so far on my cmd window and did not have the same output they got. After doing google searching, I found out that the error I was getting is related to my partition not working. So I used a usb to try and fix it, and I dont think I fixed the corrupt partition, but I got the computer to a state where it can turn on and function. My D drive was missing, but reappears when I plug in the USB.\n\nSo listen here. If you think I woke up and just thought I\u0027m some rich dude who\u0027s lazy, you\u0027re absolutely wrong. I believe in teaching a man HOW to fish, not catching a man a fish. Of course the flaw here, is I dont even know how to fish when it comes to defeating all these errors, and making the Qemu work, because it asks for things Ive never heard of and following the the videos and tutorials have not been helpful. I even did trial and error with different numbers that the qemu asked and changed the settings many times to many things I could think of. I\u0027ve searched the forum, and of course they talk about these problems but I could not find someone who had similar problems as myself. I tried having RMprep install grub4dos and syslinux. It did not help.  \n\nSo if you think I lied my butt off, your mistaken. If you think everything I described to you took a week or a day, you\u0027re mistaken again. It took a month, and now I\u0027m asking you and other forum members if they can help me. I would prefer to learn this over having it done for me, because I will need to update the flash drive as certain Windows PE\u0027s update themselves and I dont want to go on a forum to ask for help anymore. I feel very unwelcomed and I feel distrusted from what you said. Its as if this is really something someone would lie about. Regardless if one thinks I am being lazy or deceitful, I dont care. My deal stands. I hate the idea of asking help for free, as I am asking someone to take time out of their busy life to help me. I am willing to pay 50$ an hour, especially since I think this wouldnt even take 15 minutes once its done by someone who knows what they are doing. The ISO\u0027s are burning, they just arent running. People here have told me its different problems, and I\u0027ve researched the hell out of each problem with no solid conclusion. So at this point, I\u0027m looking to hire someone. If its too difficult to understand why I need help or if you believe I am lazy, then you don\u0027t have to respond to my post. You can ignore it and I\u0027ll wait here for someone who may be compassionate and understanding enough to help. I know other places where they would easily accept my money, but unfortunately, they dont focus on booting from USB. This subforum / forum is catered to help people with my problem, and so I thought it may be the right thing to do is to offer this.\n\n"

This should be in the broadest terms possible. Something like \u0027how do I join two pieces of 8\u0027x2\"x2\" to form a right-angle\u0027 and not \u0027how do I join two pieces of wood using nails\u0027.\n\n2. **Apparatus**- this is a description of the equipment. In the case of USB booting. What exactly is the USB drive (make, capacity, model, USB 2/3, how prepared, etc.). Also, if you are booting from a PC, a detailed description of the PC/notebook you are using. If using software, what version, what URL did you get it from, etc.\n\n3. **Method** - A step-by-step description of how someone else who has never done this before can reproduce what you did.\n\n4. **Results**- A detailed description of what you actually observed. This should NOT include what you think might be happening or what is supposed to happen.\n\n5. **Conclusion**- Here you can draw conclusions about what you observed\n\nNow, if you have a problem, please describe it in these terms.\n\nIf you have 20 problems, then pick problem #1 first and describe it in these terms. Once that is solved, move on to problem #2.\n\nSince 1000\u0027s of people use E2B every day, there must be something \u0027wrong\u0027 with your apparatus or method.\n\nStep #1 is to make an E2B USB drive using the method described [here](http://www.easy2boot.com/make-an-easy2boot-usb-drive/ \"External link\"). There is a video too.\n\nStep #2 is to use the \\\\QEMU_MENU_TEST (run as admin).cmd and see if you get the E2B menu.\n\nI would also suggest that you test your USB FLash drive using FakeFlashTest (or RMPrepUSB - Quick Size Test) to make sure you don\u0027t have a fake USB drive.\n\nNow if any of these steps cause you problems, then please make a post about a *specific*problem using the Aim - Apparatus - Method - Results - Conclusion headings.\n\nHTH\n\nSteve\n\n"

      "content": "Here are some examples of how confused your poorly worded posts make us (or al least me!):\n\n\u003e Next, I found out the Windows PE I was trying to use wasnt compatible with Sardu\n\nWhat WinPE are you trying to boot? Are we supposed to read your mind? How can we suggest a suitable multiboot USB solution with this much information? If SARDU has a problem with it, then it is likely to need some sort of special treatment but as we have no idea what it is, how can we possibly help! I presume you are talking about SARDU 3. Are you trying to MBR\\\\CSM boot it or UEFI-boot it?\n\n\u003e I repeat this a few times, and its another error and another and another and another, and I cant even get the qemu to work. I test it normally without the Qemu, and it still doesn\u0027t work.\n\nYou need to record the exact error message - do you have a smart phone or camera? Use it! Then you will have a record of what these magic words were and you can tell people the exact messages or even show them the screenshot. Also, you say you cannot get QEMU to work, but you posted a screenshot of a QEMU session so it clearly does work! Do you mean you cannot get QEMU to boot to the E2B menu?\n\u003e\n\u003e At one point I get a black cmd window that tells me to pull out the flash drive\n\nHave you just switched on the PC? Is it booting from the PC\u0027s hard disk or the USB drive? What was the exact message? Try to avoid the word \u0027it\u0027 when posting - be specific!\n\n\u003e So I used a usb to try and fix it, and I dont think I fixed the corrupt partition, but I got the computer to a state where it can turn on and function. My D drive was missing, but reappears when I plug in the USB.\n\n\u0027a usb\u0027 - OK what exactly was this \u0027usb\u0027.\n\n\u0027the corrupt partition\u0027 - what corrupt partition? A partition on the flash drive or a partition on the PC hard disk? How many hard disks are in the PC? How were they partitioned originally?\n\n\u0027I got to a state where it can turn on and function\u0027 - define \u0027it\u0027 - do you mean your PC can now turn on and boot? So did it not boot at all at some point? Where did you mention that your PC was unbootable? Or do you mean you can start to boot from the USB drive.\n\n\u0027My D drive was missing but reappears when I plug in the USB\u0027 - Normally a typical Windows system would have a C: volume which contains the Windows files. Now if the internal hard disk was partitioned into several volumes, Windows will assign a drive letter to each partition, so your internal hard disk may have had a C: and D: volume. When you connect a properly formatted USB drive, it will usually be assigned the next letter (E:). Now is that what you observed previously? If that is the case, but now you only see a C: volume when you boot to Windows without your USB drive connected, it sounds like you have accidentally deleted the second hard disk volume. As we don\u0027t even know how many internal hard disks are in your system or how they were partitioned, it is difficult to help you further.\n\nNow what is you first **AIM**- to get back the hard disk D: volume and all the files that were on it previously? Or is it that you don\u0027t care about the old D: volume and you just want to make a working E2B drive with your payloads? Or something else?\n\n"

      "content": "@ Everyone, I bought the pro version of Sardu from their website.  \n\n@ Wonko the insane: I\u0027m sorry if I came off as writing a book. My intention was to show briefly not specifically what I went through. That was the brief version and thats why the brief came off as a book. I wanted it brief because Ive already asked for specific help. I wanted to prove that this did take me a long time, and this has been hard on me, and that this \"bribe\" is not me being lazy, its me saying, Ive tried alot of things and now am willing to get this done. I may have 9 posts or whatever, but that doesn\u0027t mean I\u0027m a rich guy whos not willing to attempt anything. I\u0027m the opposite. I\u0027m ambitious, motivated and broke. Maybe I\u0027ll wait for my next pay check and up the price for helping me with this.   \n\n@ Wanko, thank you for being kind and understanding. Can you give me guidance, on what I can do next, because asking questions and just posting the error does not seem to be all that constructive.\n\n@Steve6375\n\nI was not trying to be specific because I was trying to show wonko the insane the overview of what I went through to show him I have not been lazy. It was to show everyone else that I have not been lazy and that hopefully they can accept my money. I know how to be specific and have done so on my previous post. I was specific when I was treated like a pinball in a bigger machine that sent me wherever it wanted to. After this happens to you, you seek other ways to get the job done, because even though life is a ride, I actually need the job done. It\u0027s similar to being in a grocery store and trying to go through all the isles, and eventually you say \"I\u0027ve searched for a couple hours and all this searching has not met the need of feeding me\". As much as I\u0027m not lazy, essentially in the end I am not meeting this need to make the multiboot USB, I am trying to. No one would ever search the grocery store for a couple hours. We all have our limits as humans before we ask for help, unless you\u0027re superman. I\u0027m not superman, I need clear and concise help, not accusations that I am lazy. I\u0027m really really am tired of the back and fourth error posting. I\u0027m a student for life and of life, and as much as I like learning, I actually need to reach a conclusion. It should not take a month to make a multiboot usb. Not when xboot can do it in a few minutes, but is discontinued and not updated.\n\nI dont want to be here for several months, I actually need this USB for project. So I hope the next posts are actually helpful without them being ad hominem attacks.   \n\n"
