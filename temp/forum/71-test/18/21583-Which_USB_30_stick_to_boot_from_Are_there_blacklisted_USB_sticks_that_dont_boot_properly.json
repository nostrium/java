      "content": "Greetings\n\nAsking which 3.0 stick to get, 32-128GB size so probably 64 preferred. There\u0027s plenty on market but it seems not all are good for booting. I want probably MLC NAND or maybe 3D one(does it even exist in flash stick market?) with some nice controller that does not overheat USB stick. What should I look at when choosing my model, I\u0027ve heard that for booting it\u0027s 4k read/writes that are most important, is that true? Some sticks can be 300MB/s for 1GB readts but their 4k writes are like 0.005MB/s, while others are 100MB/s for 1GB and 1MB/s when writing 4k. Any clues?\n\n"

With some drives this can take over 1 hour, with others a few minutes!\n\nI recommend the SanDisk Extreme 3.0 range (not the Go version).\n\n[https://rmprepusb.bl...-usb-flash.html](https://rmprepusb.blogspot.co.uk/2017/04/is-new-sandisk-extreme-pro-31-usb-flash.html \"External link\")\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n"

Would booting from SD card with SD-\\\u003eUSB adapter be option, or should I expect compatibility issues? I know many flash sticks are made in such way, there\u0027s lot of issues when trying to use them as boot devices and afraid of such SD-\\\u003eUSB scenario. Also some of cards/sticks can overheat and malfunction and I want to avoid this. I was wondering on some sticks like HyperX Savage, that is half of Sandisk Pro price here but those 4k speed are simply horrible, here\u0027s some Amazon reviewer testing fastest 256GB one, left picture:\n\n[](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61iCyc06lOL._SL256_.jpg \"External link\")\u003chttps://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61iCyc06lOL._SL256_.jpg\u003e\n\n**Edited by hemlatuyda, 12 September 2017 - 02:45 PM.**\n"

I just bought a 32kB Super\\*Talent USB 3.0 RAIDDrive (not the 3.1, now available) for US$41... were I in the US that\u0027d be about US$ 20 (because prices for imported things in Brazil are always about x2, due to importation tax)... now, when that same pendrive was available on the market, it went for US$ 255 in the US so, by buying it used, I got it for about 10% of the original price. Then again, it might have been damaged, so I took the risk. And, in what regards getting hot, it won\u0027t bur your hand, but just barely.\n\n"
