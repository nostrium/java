      "content": "Hello,\n\nseems like [this](http://www.easy2boot.com/add-payload-files/adding-windows-install-isos-without-needing-a-helper-flash-drive/ \"External link\") page describes how to add +4 GB files on FAT32 drives but I don\u0027t know which method should I use (the entire page looks really chaotic for me). Therefore I want to ask you which method should I use.\n\n* I\u0027ve downloaded a Windows 10 Pro x86 + x64 ISO which size is 5.6GB\n* My drive is formatted as FAT32 for compatibility reasons (I had multiple PC\u0027s which couldn\u0027t boot a NTFS drive) so I can\u0027t just copy the ISO on it\n* I want to install Windows 10 using [the VHD method](http://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-use-a-vhd-to-dual-boot-windows-8-on-a-windows-7-pc/ \"External link\") for testing, and then maybe install it as a main OS\n* Currently I have Windows 8.1 installed in **non**-UEFI mode, I\u0027m mentioning it because I think it might be important\n\nSo how do I copy the Windows 10 ISO file on my drive?\n\n"

It is possible that some motherboards use the FAT boot sector to determine the geometry of the USB storage devices, and even worse, some motherboards could decide to not boot from the non-FAT USB drives. Quite often there are reports about the NTFS boot failure whereas (on the same machine) FAT32 no problems.   \n"

      "content": "You could try splitting the install.wim file into pieces that are less than 4GB each, then copy those files onto USB or make an E2B drive. Google for split wim or swm. If the ISO contains more than one edition of 10 (Home, Pro, Enterprise, etc), then you can delete the file called ei.cfg in the \\\\sources\\\\ folder, so that Setup will allow you to choose the edition you want. I\u0027m wondering, where did you get a 10 ISO that is over 5GB? Is it 100% official, or modified (pirated, had updates/drivers integrated into it, etc)? I don\u0027t think Microsoft would release a 10 ISO that has an install.wim/install.esd larger than 4GB, because this would make it difficult to boot the installer in UEFI mode, in which case FAT32 is generally required.  \n\nEdit: If your ISO has an install.ESD in \\\\sources\\\\, then you may need to decrypt it first, then convert it to install.wim. Then you can split the WIM into smaller pieces. ESD Decrypter can do both of these.\n\n[http://www.easy2boot...per-flash-drive](http://www.easy2boot.com/add-payload-files/adding-windows-install-isos-without-needing-a-helper-flash-drive/ \"External link\")  \n\nRead method 1 in the section called \"UEFI booting: How to add Windows 7/8/10 installers with \\\u003e4GB Install.wim files\". There are other ways you can do this but I think that splitting the wim then creating an E2B drive from files, will be the easiest way. Make sure you read the part about splitting the WIM into 3000MB chunks, you can\u0027t just use any size or you\u0027ll hit issues. I found this out a few years ago and was searching for the info so I could post a link, but happened to find it on E2B\u0027s pages. I had tried to install 8.1 with a \\\u003e4GB WIM and got the same issue as you. Also, at any points on the linked page that steve6375 refers only to Windows 8/8.1, it will also generally work with 10.\n\n"

      "content": "Your other machines probably had issues booting from NTFS because maybe the partition wasn\u0027t marked as active/bootable, or it didn\u0027t contain a proper bootcode/bootsector. A FAT32 partition doesn\u0027t need to be marked as active to boot in UEFI mode. How old are these machines? If they aren\u0027t relatively new then they should be capable of both legacy MBR and UEFI booting. Do their BIOSes have options for legacy MBR/CSM? If so it needs to be toggled on for MBR booting to work. Or maybe you have less common hardware like mine, which can boot in either mode without having to toggle an option (which in my case means I only need to disable Secure Boot and activate CSM, then I can boot in either mode without toggling again).\n\n"

But since several other problems arose with that image, I got rid of that ISO and downloaded the separate ones from Microsoft. Now I\u0027m working on Windows 7 images with all recent updates included, hence the 5 GB+ size.\n\nAbout the other machines - I went through every single relevant BIOS option (legacy boot/MBR etc), none of which has helped. I prepared the NTFS drive using RMPrepUSB and I made sure it\u0027s already set to active. That Acer laptop just refused to boot from it. I believe it was bought about 5 years ago, so it\u0027s not as ancient as certain notebooks I used to repair.\n\n**Edited by TheReduxPL, 24 September 2016 - 11:15 AM.**\n"
