Can you suggest a good malware remover and antivirus software?\n\nNo particular ideas.\n\nI can only tell you - in the case of - not necessarily \"malware\" but also \"OS corruption\" - that often ComboFix:\n\n[http://www.bleepingc...nload/combofix/](http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/combofix/ \"External link\")\n\nsolved issues that no other program could.\n\nAbout \"malware\" (not necessarily \"virus\") HijackThis:\n\n[http://www.bleepingc...oad/hijackthis/](http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/hijackthis/ \"External link\")\n\nis/was often useful (it only partially works on newer than XP OS).\n\nI have seen poitive reports about RogueKiller:\n\n[http://www.bleepingc...ad/roguekiller/](http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/roguekiller/ \"External link\")\n\nbut never used it personally.\n\nPersonally I have no particular preference for antivirus programs, the only thing I recommend is \"please NOT Panda\" and \"please NOT, NOT, NOT Symantec/Norton Antivirus\" (they are not \"worse\" than other ones AFAICT, but they are - at least last time I happened to use them - an enormous amount of BLOAT, slowing machines to a crawl...\n\n![:duff:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/duff.gif)\n\nWonko\n\n"
