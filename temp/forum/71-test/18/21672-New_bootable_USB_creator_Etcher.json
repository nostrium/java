It protects you from accidentally writing to your hard-drives, ensures every byte of data was written correctly and much more.\n\n![screenshot.gif](https://etcher.io/static/screenshot.gif)  \n\nI\u0027ve tried it out since this was the recommended way to install the Ubuntu .ISO from a USB drive. It has worked really good so far.  \n\nPlus points besides the easy interface is that it can be used across multiple operating systems.  \n\nThe tool is kind of ad-ware, since it will promote its pro edition after flashing the drive. Nevertheless, very well developed and worked as expected.  \n\n![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif)   \n"
