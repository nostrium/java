      "content": "Hello,   \n\nCan I make a usb flash be detected and act like a floppy in windows?  \n\nPossibly without grub4dos and more like dd, fdisk or rmprepusb tools.  \n\nI am certain this is possible in a hardware way by manipulating controller chip and rewrite its memory, and I wanted to know if it might be possible by software.  \n\nObviously, simply dd\u0027ing the floppy image to usb doesn\u0027t work.  \n\nYou might want to say to use a floppy disk. I know how a floppy disk looks, but given the notebook manufacturers consider it out of spec there might be some usb way, since we have usb ports.  \n\nYou might ask why I need this? For flashing bios recovery under dos. There is a recovery bios key combination\n\n```\n( fn +b + power)\n```\n\nwhich when pressed attempts to read for a floppy or usb containing the bios to write and other dos tools.   \n\nOne problem that I might be encountering is using 32 gb usb formated with a partition with 1 gb for using fat filesystem.   \n\nAnd I need to disassembly more the recovery part from the bios in order to find the filename...  \n\nThanks!   \n"

      "content": "Yes. While pressing the combination for bios crisis recovery, it reboots, this means something with the flash is not right. Will try further. From this the ideea if I can make the flash detected as a floppy drive because I have a recovery floppy binary image. Or as a cd because when disassembling bios code I saw a bunch of ELTORITO specifications.  \n\nSo, can I plug a usb and the bios detect it as floppy?  \n\nWill recheck the stick creation.  \n\nEdit: Most bioses will access the usb just fine when running at full capacity and integrity. But IF this is a part from a bios ( from a bad bios flash), especcially the BIOS block which deals with a restrained system and offers small recovery procedure?  \n\nEdit2: The eltorito spec support floppy booting with cds...   \n"

So I will try that! One can even host a contest - the smallest usb you can buy ...  \n\nNow I tried with 4gb and the WinCrisis phoenix tool. Didn\u0027t worked.  \nTo try next:  \n- Steve method: How can I flash custom boot sector.bin in RMPrepUSB? Wanted to try 300 size, FDD boot and a custom boot sector other than the ones listed? Maybe with DD too.  \n- create a virtual IMG file, mount as floppy, use WinCrisis app and then DD the image to usb  \n- using the previous image create an EL TORITO boot as FDD CD image to burn and try that instead ...  \n- disassembly more bios to see why it\u0027s not recognised ...  \n- buy a cheap eeprom programmer and use that since the BIOS chip is removable dip package yes.  \n\nAny thoughts?   \n"

      "content": "In some cases, historically a \"double way\" approach, i.e. something that is at the same time a super-floppy and a partitioned hd-like device worked around some BIOS issues (please read as makebootFAT), but if the issue is with the BIOS \"emergency block\" and somehow you need it to become \"drive A:\" it is entirely possible that an actual floppy (and nothing else, exception made for some - now not findable anymore - USB sticks, I seem to remember by Netac, Steve6375 used them, that had a physical switch to emulate a floppy) would do.  \nBut, usually, a USB floppy drive works, of course it depends on specific motherboards/BIOSes.  \n\nA floppy emulation El Torito also should get drive A:.  \n\nThe \"easiest\" (not necessarily the best) way to make such a CD from a floppy image is referenced here:  \n[http://reboot.pro/to...brided/?p\u003d86679](http://reboot.pro/topic/9916-grub4dos-isohybrided/?p\u003d86679 \"\")  \n[http://www.menuetos.net/cdboot.htm](http://www.menuetos.net/cdboot.htm \"External link\")  \n\n![:duff:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/duff.gif)  \nWonko   \n"
