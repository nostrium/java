Sad, it was very handy.\n\nSo I\u0027ll duplicate PartedMagic: ISO + imgPTN\n\nand use imgPTN for almost every other Distributions/OS.\n\nAnother think that makes me cry is the fact that older computers cannot see new big usb keys as my brand new 32GB usb 3.0... and neighther plop boot cd nor usb_boot cd seem to work with easy2boot which claims it is read only... It could have been so simple: one big and fast key + PLOP CD for older computer.\n\n**Edited by toto08998, 26 September 2016 - 06:31 PM.**\n"

Are you using the latest version of E2B 1.84? If so, try the Utilities - grub4dos USB driver menu entry after booting with Plop.\n\nPlop seems to recognise a wider range of USB controllers than the grub4dos driver, but only the grub4dos driver is rd/wr (Plop uses a read-only driver)..\n\nP.S. Be aware that using .imgPTN files carries a small risk of corruption of your USB drive. Things can, and sometimes do, go wrong. Booting from an ISO should be \u0027safer\u0027. Also some linux ISOs can be MBR-booted even in read-only mode using the ISOBOOT method. See List 1c at [http://www.easy2boot...-payload-files/](http://www.easy2boot.com/add-payload-files/list-of-tested-payload-files/ \"External link\"). Some linux ISOs can be MBR and UEFI-booted by using the grub2 menu system for E2B - but this requires bespoke menus for different linux distros and can be quite \u0027picky\u0027.\n\n**Edited by steve6375, 26 September 2016 - 06:54 PM.**\n"

It hangs early after CSM menu when PartedMagic begin to start.\n\nAll other Distributions/OS work fine using imgPTN.\n\nAs expected, Win10x64 installation using imgPTN does not show a product keys selection as when booting from ISO. Sad, it was very handy.\n\nSo I\u0027ll duplicate PartedMagic: ISO + imgPTN\n\nand use imgPTN for almost every other Distributions/OS.\n\nAnother think that makes me cry is the fact that older computers cannot see new big usb keys as my brand new 32GB usb 3.0... and neighther plop boot cd nor usb_boot cd seem to work with easy2boot which claims it is read only... It could have been so simple: one big and fast key + PLOP CD for older computer.\n\n**Edited by toto08998, 26 September 2016 - 06:31 PM.**\n"

Are you using the latest version of E2B 1.84? If so, try the Utilities - grub4dos USB driver menu entry after booting with Plop.\n\nPlop seems to recognise a wider range of USB controllers than the grub4dos driver, but only the grub4dos driver is rd/wr (Plop uses a read-only driver)..\n\nP.S. Be aware that using .imgPTN files carries a small risk of corruption of your USB drive. Things can, and sometimes do, go wrong. Booting from an ISO should be \u0027safer\u0027. Also some linux ISOs can be MBR-booted even in read-only mode using the ISOBOOT method. See List 1c at [http://www.easy2boot...-payload-files/](http://www.easy2boot.com/add-payload-files/list-of-tested-payload-files/ \"External link\"). Some linux ISOs can be MBR and UEFI-booted by using the grub2 menu system for E2B - but this requires bespoke menus for different linux distros and can be quite \u0027picky\u0027.\n\n**Edited by steve6375, 26 September 2016 - 06:54 PM.**\n"

      "content": "OK I do not think it is a bug. For a board firmware (or BIOS) everything is really the same but the different companies use different wordings or settings in their menus. The system will choose to boot something first. We can see this on Asus boards. In CSM settings their boot control will say something like \"UEFI first.\" So it would seem to me that a board set like that could boot a legacy USB key if no EFI ability were present. But if it is present, it will boot in EFI. If you were to set it for Legacy only and had a USB that could do either, it should be able to boot in Legacy mode right?  \n\nAlso another reason why I wouldn\u0027t want to say it is a bug. Do we know exactly how a given firmware goes about its process? In the case of the Asus boards if set to UEFI first, does it:  \n1. Look for UEFI bootable devices first, and if found, boot them as according to the boot order set?  \n2. Try to boot the first device according to boot order in UEFI mode blindly, and then boot it in Legacy mode if it fails?  \n3. Look at all devices and then determine what boot methods they have and then process them as per the settings?  \n\nI had to put #2 in there because I can see this type of shortcut being made.   \n"
