You can also tinker with any other controls there. Point is, once enabled you have overcome all hurdles to make your Zalman ZM-VE400 back into an iodd2541.\n\nAfter you finished uploading the firmware, exit and unplug, then replug the device. Voila: it\u0027ll start flashing the new firmware. After that you\u0027ll be greeted by Korean glyphs and have to use the navigation and Menu and Enter buttons to make your way to the settings menu and change the language to English.\n\nAnd you\u0027re golden.\n\nWhenever you replug the device it will now report as iodd2541 in the display.\n\nThere are also some hidden features in the firmware updater which I am currently investigating.\n\n"

Very simple process.\n\nUhm, actually you should realize that Zalman is the reseller in that case. iODD creates the product and it gets rebranded to Zalman. So having the ability to flash the iODD firmware really helps in that case, because you can technically make your Zalman into an iODD device proper.\n\nAnd flashing the firmware from iODD onto the Zalman and vice versa is trivial, but you still need to know how. That\u0027s what this topic is about.\n\n"

      "content": "Hi all,\n\nI found an easy solution to get the latest IODD firmware on my Zalman VE-300.\n\n1. Get the \"eda_preview270.exe\" tool from post #2\n2. Get iODD2531_user_fw_writer_02R1288N_x86.zip from the iodd.kr homepage (Support - Downloads - 2531 (VE300) - NTFS - Old) and unpack it\n3. Get iODD_2531_user_fw_writer_04(R1558N)_x86.EXE\n4. Run the firmware writer 02R1288N (as administrator)\n5. Run the EDA tool (as administrator)\n6. Drag-and-drop the crosshair of the EDA tool on the disabled \"Update\" button of the firmware writer\n7. Activate the \"enabled\" checkbox in the EDA tool, right below the checked \"visible\" box. With your VE-300 device connected, press the update button. The old updater is not so picky about the installed firmware on the device as the recent one.\n8. After finishing the update, power off the VE-300 and reconnect it. Now you have a \"iodd2531\" device with an outdated firmware.\n9. Run the latest firmware writer_04(R1558N). Since you have a valid iodd firmware on your device, the updater is happy with it. Just press the update button.\n10. After finishing the update, power off the VE-300 and reconnect it.\n11.

Get the \"eda_preview270.exe\" tool from post #2\n\u003e 2. Get iODD2531_user_fw_writer_02R1288N_x86.zip from the iodd.kr homepage (Support - Downloads - 2531 (VE300) - NTFS - Old) and unpack it\n\u003e 3. Get iODD_2531_user_fw_writer_04(R1558N)_x86.EXE\n\u003e 4. Run the firmware writer 02R1288N (as administrator)\n\u003e 5. Run the EDA tool (as administrator)\n\u003e 6.

So having the ability to flash the iODD firmware really helps in that case, because you can technically make your Zalman into an iODD device proper.\n\nAnd flashing the firmware from iODD onto the Zalman and vice versa is trivial, but you still need to know how. That\u0027s what this topic is about.\n\n"

Drag-and-drop the crosshair of the EDA tool on the disabled \"Update\" button of the firmware writer\n7. Activate the \"enabled\" checkbox in the EDA tool, right below the checked \"visible\" box.
