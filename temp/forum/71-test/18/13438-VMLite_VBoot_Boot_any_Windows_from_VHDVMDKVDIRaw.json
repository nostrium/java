Or read will be repeated each time, when access is again required to that portion? It may actually slow down overall performance after boot, hence sounds like a tradeoff rather then clear performance improvement.  \n\nWould you consider offering a Free Licence for personal use for Vboot, while requiring Pay Licence for VMLite (or vice versa, or a product line with raising feature sets)? The reason seems to be in the very basic fact that you use Grub 2 for booting files, and its free. Or it won\u0027t work that way? Generally, asking to pay doesn\u0027t guarantee by itself much profit, unless suplemented by a strong marketing plan, especially when market (demand) is under-developed, while offering strong free boot soft choices. :smile:   \n"

I\u0027m using vboot as an alternative or a complement to winvblock and grub4dos methods to boot vhd files, but I assume it offers a lot of other features (some unique) that I haven\u0027t tried yet. VBoot comes with a virtual floppy image, vdisk.img, that can be used in a similar fashion to winvblock.ima (or firadisk.ima) to install windows iso to vhd.  \n\n2. So why use vboot instead of grub4dos and winvblock? i\u0027m sure there are lots of reasons, but in my very focused case I was having trouble using g4d/winvblock to create a [full universal xp.vhd](http://reboot.pro/13731/ \"\"), however, vboot worked. I was also able to install the winvblock driver properly once inside the running vbooted vhd system -- now it seems to boot fine with g4d/winvblock (although declaring success may be premature).  \n\n3. Don\u0027t be afraid of the vboot \"install.\" It can be very minimal on Win XP at least and the instructions in the readme file are clear. All I had to do was to download vboot-v1.zip (10.5 MB) from ireneuszp\u0027s site, unzip to C:\\\\ (system partition), and copy 2 small files (vbootldr and vbootldr.mbr) to C:\\\\. To use vboot during boot-up you either add a reference to it into your boot.ini (C:\\\\vbootldr.mbr\u003d\"VBoot\"), or you can chainload it from grub4dos menu per ireneuszp\u0027s instructions. Inside C:\\\\vboot\\\\grub you have a file called grub.cfg that seems equivalent to the menu.lst file in grub4dos. It has some basic example entries for installing windows xp or 7 from iso to vhd. You need to edit them to fit your iso and vhd names, but that part is self-explanatory. There\u0027s also a command to create a vhd, but I didn\u0027t use it. The documentation (readme.html file) is fairly clear at least for people with some basic experience with grub4dos or similar.  \n\n4. I\u0027m not sure what the larger VMLite installer files do, (VMLiteWorkstationSetup.exe \u003d 65 MB, VMLiteWorkstationPluginSetup.exe \u003d 57.5 MB), but I didn\u0027t install them nor do I think they are required for basic vboot functionality.   \n"
