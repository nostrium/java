      "content": "Hi,\n\nI want to make a USB that contains multiple ISO files for windows 7/10 installations for different types of thin clients.\n\nThe installation for thin clients is different than a conventional windows installation.\n\nThe ISO needs to be seen as the root device (like it is the USB itself)\n\nAlso the USB needs to be booted as a secure device with uefi, is this possible?\n\nI\u0027m not realy experianced with these kind of usbs.\n\nBut I have experimented with Yumi mapping with grub4dos etc.\n\nwith no luck.\n\ncan someone help me with making this?\n\n"

      "content": "Secure booting will limit your choices.\n\nYou have some choices depending on how \u0027unattended\u0027 you want the install.\n\nI don\u0027t know about thin client installation being different from normal Windows installation - can you explain more in what way it differs?\n\nSome options are:\n\n1. WinSetupFomUSB (not sure if this supports secure boot?)\n\n2. Boot to WinPE and run WinNTSetup.exe which allows you to choose any ISO and the target partitions. You can also run a script to partition and format the drive and choose any XML file for unattended installs\n\n3. SARDU (I have not tested this)\n\n4. My Easy2Boot project\n\nIf you only want to boot to a variety of Windows Installers, I would try WinSetupFromUSB first.\n\n**Edited by steve6375, 22 February 2017 - 10:51 PM.**\n"
