Better then the older model the \u0027 I-Odd 2501 USB disk enclosure  \n\u003e By default, the virtual drive shows up as a BD-ROM drive on your computer, so even if you don\u0027t have a Blu-ray drive, you kind of do with the ZM-VE200\n[![bluray.jpg](http://reboot.pro/uploads/monthly_03_2011/post-5-0-64042800-1299379387_thumb.jpg)](http://reboot.pro/uploads/monthly_03_2011/post-5-0-64042800-1299379387.jpg \"bluray.jpg - Size: 4.29KB\"){#ipb-attach-url-11892-0-81715800-1676066451}   \n\nJust received mine thru the mail.   \n[![zalmandrive.jpg](http://reboot.pro/uploads/monthly_03_2011/post-5-0-54879200-1299378388_thumb.jpg)](http://reboot.pro/uploads/monthly_03_2011/post-5-0-54879200-1299378388.jpg \"zalmandrive.jpg - Size: 32.75KB\"){#ipb-attach-url-11891-0-81709300-1676066451}   \n\nThe ZALMAN ZM-VE200 is based on the licensed design from Iodd.  \nMore detailed review and some great tips\\[[ZM-VE200 megatechnews.com Review](http://www.megatechnews.com/megatech-reviews-zalman-zm-ve200-external-hdd-case-and-virtual-drive/ \"External link\")\\]  \n\nZM-VE200 has some great overal improvements from the get go. Well done so far in my testing.  \n\nOn watching the video on Disassembling the iodd \\[[Video for Disassembling](http://www.ioddusa.com/downloads/43-documents/67-video-demonstration-of-installing-a-hard-drive \"External link\")\\].  \nyou will notice that the person disassembling the device use\u0027s a bit of force to open the case. Not so with the ZM-VE200.  \nI was a bit afraid after watching the iodd video of breaking something.  \n\nWith Disassembling the ZM-VE200 there is no more struggle to take it apart in order to insert the drive into the case.  \n\nTo insert youre drive on iodd 2501 was harder as you can see from the picture you had to disassemble it.  \n[![iodd.jpg](http://reboot.pro/uploads/monthly_03_2011/post-5-0-89396100-1299376231_thumb.jpg)](http://reboot.pro/uploads/monthly_03_2011/post-5-0-89396100-1299376231.jpg \"iodd.jpg - Size: 13.35KB\"){#ipb-attach-url-11886-0-81668700-1676066451}   \n\nWith the ZM-VE200 the only thing you do is an easy 4 steps no disassembling .

How much experimenting have you done?  \n\nHave you tried whether ISOs that don\u0027t boot properly such as the ones that display **can\u0027t find live media** (even though the ISO is extracted on root of the drive) actually boot without any mods? Just drop the ISO and boot? Also is there a max number of ISOs you can boot? Have you also tried whether WIN_7PE non WIM ISO boots properly without BSOD? If all this works, I am getting one.   \n"

In order to boot from the Virtual DVD/Bluray drive you need iso\u0027s to be in the root of the drive under a folder name \"_iso\"  \n.  \n\u003e max number of ISOs\nI think the limit is youre drive space. I think you can nest folders with ISOs in the _iso folder and thus select the folder then the Iso to boot.

      "content": "\u003e Ok what I meant is, when booting some live Linux distributions of a UFD via GRUB4DOS, when they try to mount the live media file system such as squashfs or whatever it is called and others, it fails and drops you to a shell prompt. If you are lucky, you can mount the file system and continue booting. For some the solution would be to copy this live media file to the UFD while also preserving the path (same path as within the ISO) and that normally works. However for some it doesn\u0027t and this is probably because the cdrom device is hard coded in the init script and it only searches CDs. Now if somehow ZM-VE200 fools the system to appear as a CD device, booting this ISOs will work. If you don\u0027t mind, see if you can get G-DATA Live AV to work by simply dropping the ISO.\n\n\u003e Link: [https://www.gdatasof...e/download.html](https://www.gdatasoftware.com/support/main-subjects/upgrade-service/download.html \"External link\") and scroll down  \n\u003e\n\u003e I had problems with the 2010 version so may be this latest one will not have any problems.

This means you will have \"Program Files\" and \"Windows\" directory inside the ISO instead of within the WIM file. To do this, in \"Main Configuration\", for Build Model select \"Normal\" instead of \"In RAM\". Once the build is completed, drop the ISO and see if it boots. (If you inspect the ISO contents you will see there isn\u0027t a WIM file and \"Program Files\" and \"Windows\" are on the root of the ISO). Currently when I build the ISO this way, to boot the system of a UFD I extract the entire ISO contents to a UFD and use USBBootWatcher - **usbbootwatcher /prepare X:\\\\windows\\\\system32** where X: is the drove letter of the UFD. If you try to boot the ISO any other way it blue screens so it would be interesting to see if this works.  \nAs you said, I also received blue screen. ![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif) Is there a way to make it work.  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nUsing Wim Option works.   \n"

Of course the disadvantages of this is that if you damage the registry or get spyware, on the next boot it will still be there because the whole installation is outside the WIM image.

I tried it on another .ima file and that loaded too! I tried it on an ISO and that loaded too!  \n\u003e So now I have A: and B: and the ISO on J:. Both A: and B: are read/write which is useful!  \n\u003e If I remove the USB cable - wait 20 seconds - then re-insert the USB cable - it seems to remember what I loaded last and My Computer shows A: B: and J: again! If I try to load the same IMA file it says \u0027ALREADY HIT\u0027. I tried three IMA files and it seems to think all 3 are loaded as it says ALREADY HIT when I try to select any of the three again even after a power down.

Not to bad. You can have 4 multiple floppy drives. I was thinking unloading would be as easy as with the iso\u0027s. Glad you found the way to unmount them.

Yes you are limited to 32 iso images in the root of your bootable _iso folder, but you can have subfolders off the root and load the subfolders with another 32 iso\u0027s etc. The thumbwheel/LCD interface allows you to browse and select your desired iso from the subfolders too so do NOT think you are limited to 32 isos in your bootable folder, its much much more than that, howmuch?

      "content": "Umm... this is USB 101 type stuff.  \n\nThe power requirements for your drive installed in the Zalman were not met by the front ports of the PC. The front ports typically deliver less amperage than the rear. The rear ports are ususally connected directly to the motherboard, the front ports have short cables that connect to the usb header that contribute to voltage drop as well. Weak power from the 5v bus is the bane of any high demand USB device esp hard drives which can demand up to an amp or more of 5V power to spin up. Yes, your Zalman will light up and show a display, but if the drive inside wont spin due to low amperage delivered from the USB power, then it simply will not perform.  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nAn external 5V power input is lacking in the Zalman, which I feel would be a great addition in the next version, that would eliminate the problem. One workaround may be to use a dual USB cable to try to suck additional amperage from some other USB port on the system, and that usually works. However if the system has a generally weak 5V rail, then its either a power supply problem with having a weak, noisy or bad 5V rail or a voltage distribution problem on the motherboard.  \n\nI use my Zalman daily and have found it very indispensable. Some systems simply will not boot from it however. The bios settings are there to boot from USB drives etc, it just does not get seen by the bios at all. Recently an HP DV7 laptop just would not cooperate with it for me. Read up this thread to workaround some Dell Latitude issues I\u0027ve seen as well.   \n"

      "content": "You will need to use a USB dual Y-cable. Some notebooks will not provide enough power if you just use a single USB cable (not had any problem with a PC though). The lower they make the 5V rail voltage on a notebook, the longer the notebook battery will last, so the 5V USB voltage tends to be on the low side on notebooks - also the limiting resistor/fuse in the USB supply tends to be quite a high value as they don\u0027t want you shorting out the power to the mainboard or causing internal damage by plugging in a \u0027bad\u0027 USB device.  \n\nIt also depends on the power requirements of the 2.5\" drive that you fit, as well as the computer 5V supply. The spec for USB 2 is 500mA per USB port. HDD spin-up often requires much more than this.  \n\nThe spec of an ATX PC PSU is 5V +/- 5%. This means that an ATX PSU could deliver a 5V rail voltage as low as 4.75V - allow for a voltage drop across USB fuses and in-line current measuring resistors, etc. within the PC and this brings it down to 4.5V. The greater the load, the more the voltage drop. Also the Zalman may have a protective diode in series with the power rail which will bring it down another 0.2 to 0.6V (depending on what components they use, e.g. Schottky diodes, high power diodes with a low forward voltage drop or an active circuit using a FET, etc.).  \n\nFor this reason, I always use a PSU in my PC which delivers at least 5.1V on the 5V rail (a good PSU should do this anyway). Voltage drop on the front header cable and your external cable just makes the situation worse!   \n"

      "content": "With all due respect, you have it wrong. ![:ph34r:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/scared9.gif)  \n\nThe problem (which yes can generally be solved with a USB Y cable) is not about Volts, it is about Amperes.  \nBy design a USB port will be made to deliver 500 mA at 5 V (this is the USB standard).  \nObviously a lot of motherboard manufacturers simply ignore this and give ports from which you can get 600 mA or more and another lot respect the standrdard and provide, say, 501 mA.  \nWhat really \"drives\" the drive (if you pardon me the pun :wink:) is the actual power, expressed in Watts, given by V x A x pf\u003dW (where pf is a power factor ideally equal to 1, but usually in a range between 0.90 and 0.95).  \nThe power factor is typical of the device (and to the connections through which the electricity flows to it), so it is a constant for a given device/port and we can omit in the following.  \nAn increase in voltage of 0.1 Volt on a 5V rail gives very little advantage. (roughly 0.1/5\u003d 2%)  \nTheoretical:  \n5 V x 0.5 A\u003d 2.5 W  \n**steve6375** \u0027s theoretical  \n5.1 V x 0.5 A \u003d 2.55 W  \nbetter, but not such a grat deal  \nWhen you use a \"Y cable\" things change dramatically:  \nTheoretical:  \n5 V x 2 x 0.5 A \u003d5.00 W  \nThe bad case of a really low 5V rail:  \n4.75 V x 2 x 0.5 A \u003d 4.75 W  \n\nNormally a device targeted for 5 V can usually work allright in a +/- 15% range (as always there may be exceptions).  \n\nSo keeping the 5 V rail a little bit higher is a good thing and helps in having the device getting an actual voltage nearer the specs ![:thumbsup:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/thumbsup.gif), but it is not \"effective\" and not even comparable to a good ol\u0027 Y cable.  \n\nIn the speciific case of a USB external case such as this thingy discussed here what really counts is the make/model of the actual 2.5\" hard disk you put in the enclosure (normally on the HD label there is the actual power requirement expressed in Amperes).  \n\n![:cheers:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/cheers.gif)  \nWonko   \n"

      "content": "Well, sort of we are both right. It is about Amps, but large currents cause huge voltage drops. Some devices do not do a \u0027power on reset\u0027 correctly if the initial connection voltage is too low and they certainly won\u0027t say they are \u0027ready\u0027 until the voltage reaches an acceptable level.  \n\nUSB ports limit the current using a resistor and a fuse (normally these are self-healing e.g. PolySwitch or PPTC) which also has resistance. These drop voltage and limit current. The more current you take from the USB port, the more the voltage drops. The USB spec is that you can draw 500mA per port, but the voltage is allowed to drop by 5% **when at a nominal 5V** . However, if you have a USB port which is already at say 4.8V (as the PSU is delivering 4.8V on the 5V rail), and then you take 500mA, it can drop to well below 4.75V but both the ATX PSU and the USB port circuit are officially within spec! This is a huge flaw in the USB spec. + ATX PSU spec. The HDD won\u0027t report a \u0027ready\u0027 state as the voltage is way too low (at least until it spins up and on some drives they don\u0027t initialise properly at all!).  \nA well designed USB port should also include a reservoir capacitor - this takes the initial surge when you first connect the USB device and also prevents the fuse from blowing on initial connection. Some badly designed ports (e.g. front USB ports on a badly designed PCB) don\u0027t have these. With a hard disk it is the initial surge that is the problem (as they often contain lots of large capacitors) as well as the spin-up current. It will take a while for the platters to spin up and meanwhile the drive is not ready - thus the BIOS won\u0027t boot from it.  \n\nIncidentally, these PolySwitches are responsible for a lot of \u0027black magic\u0027 and waving of chicken bones! Because in some designs, the USB ports are powered by the 5V standby (so that you keyboard can wake up the system), you often need to unplug the system from the mains in order to remove the power from the USB PolySwitch fuses and allow them to heal. The \u0027official spec\u0027 heal time for a PolySwitch is 1 hour, but often 10-20 mins is enough.  \ne.g. you get reports from people on Forums saying \u0027My USB port did not work until I changed my graphics card and then it worked - so I suggest you buy another graphics card to fix your USB ports\u0027 - what they really mean is \u0027my USB port did not work until I unplugged my system from the mains for 20 minutes to allow the PolySwitch to heal!\u0027.   \n"

      "content": "IMHO temp has not been an issue. The modest amount of current drawn from the internal controller pales in comparison to the current drawn from the drive itself. A good choice of drive is the crux of the issue when used with any enclosure. Current draw in milliamps is an imperfect, but adequate judge of how energy much it wastes in heat. Keep power requirements low and balance speed with current draw. Keep in mind current draw is often not stated as \"sustained\" draw, but rather maximum current draw which is usually at the time of initial spin-up. Sustaining that speed takes much less current than starting it to spin.  \n\nI myself will not go below 5400 rpm for a portable drive for simple speed reasons. If you look around you can get 7200rpm drives that spin up at 500-700ma easily. So balance the rpm, current draw at spinnup, and capacity to find the drive that suits your needs. If you can find sustained current draw specs for a potential drive, then great. Lower is better.   \n\nOf course SSD drives will blow any spinning drive out of the water in all those respects. But until I can afford an SSD to use in my VROM drive, I\u0027ll reserve judgement.   \n\n**Edited by Grif, 25 October 2011 - 04:50 AM.**\n"

But did you know that it is not limited to that?. .ima is a raw image format, and the ve200 appears to mount it as such. I created a raw image of a dual partition hard drive using ddrescue in linux. I gave the image an .ima extension. I had to defrag with defraggler to make it contiguous. I then selected it on the ve200. It showed up in windows as a whole drive with both partitions! And it is read/write capable. I have not tried to boot it from that, but this shows it is capable of using raw hard drive images well beyond the floppy.

Also need to eliminate errors such as flaky, underpowered USB ports (the bane of my existance!) , and make sure the drive and esp the image files are contiguous (windows defrag and/or sysinternals \"contig\" seem to fix particular probs).   \n\nOne last hint for use, when faced with flakey underpowered USB ports, use one of those dual USB cords combined with a cellphone 5V 1A USB cellphone charger. The charger will supply plenty of power unless you have made a poor choice of the actual drive in the first place. IMHO the case should only be populated with a drive with initial spinup requirements of 700ma maximum. 500ma is nominal, but drives requiring a full 1 AMP of 5V DC will be very problematic.  \n\nAn \"iphone cube\" charger is fine. Others work as well. I use a cube since it is very small and provides a full 1 amp which is plenty to spin up my particular drive. The ve200 is literally one of my prize possessions and if it failed, I would only buy another. The only thing possibly competing of course is the ISOSTICK. which appears not nearly as versatile, tho I would love to get one of those eventually as well.  \n\nYes, support is hard to find, but if you dig a bit you can find help. I just hope Zalman or iodd dont give up on it. After all it\u0027s a product with a small niche market comprised mostly of PC techs. Like I said, to me its almost invaluable.   \n\n**Edited by Grif, 20 February 2012 - 05:19 AM.**\n"

      "content": "\u003e I just got one of these ve200 enclosures. It is pretty cool to be able to load any iso you want from it. But since there is very little info on it (almost none on the website), I wanted to elaborate on something. The ability to load .ima floppy images is great. But did you know that it is not limited to that?. .ima is a raw image format, and the ve200 appears to mount it as such. I created a raw image of a dual partition hard drive using ddrescue in linux. I gave the image an .ima extension. I had to defrag with defraggler to make it contiguous. I then selected it on the ve200. It showed up in windows as a whole drive with both partitions! And it is read/write capable. I have not tried to boot it from that, but this shows it is capable of using raw hard drive images well beyond the floppy. The ve200 is somewhat quirky, but it seems like it is an awesome tool. I can\u0027t believe the documentation/support sucks so bad.  \nNice find! I made a 300MB FreeDOS disk using RMPrepUSB on a USB stick, then made a 300MB TEST.IMA image of it using the Drive -\\\u003e File button in RMPrepUSB and put it on the VE200. I can boot from it just fine and it is read/write. ![:clap:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/clap.gif)   \n"

      "content": "You can also make an empty file (or use any file for that matter), put the .ima extension on it, mount it on the zalman and it will show up as an unformatted drive. You can then format it and do as you wish with it. One of the quirks I am noticing is that windows doesn\u0027t always see the second drive of my dual partition image. It shows it exists in drive management, but not in a usable form.  \n\nAlso, if you change the mode to dual (even if it already is) while it is powered on, you can get the main drive to show up. However the main drive will be in read only mode (don\u0027t know why), but your image file will still be read/write. This can also be quirky and doesn\u0027t always show up. But you can get it to show an iso, an image, and the main drive at the same time.  \n\nI had it plugged into a Dell laptop trying to boot an iso that that laptop didn\u0027t like, powered off the laptop, and then the zalman would not come up at all on that usb port. The screen on the zalman was even blank except for the lock status and hard drive status. Moved it to a different port and it started working again. Not sure if that was the fault of the laptop or the zalman.   \n\n**Edited by maximus57, 20 February 2012 - 05:48 PM.**\n"

Not saying it CANT be used on USB 2.0, but its power requirements esp if you factor in the current draw of the controller in the Zalman case itself might pose reliability problems esp on older systems with weak 5v rails to the USB. For USB 3.0, it should not pose a problem whatsoever, so that drive would be great for the ZM-VE300 if used on a USB 3.0 bus because USB 3.0 spec provides much more current, a full one amp @ 5V per device if I recall.  \n\nYes, there can be ways around this, but for USB 2.0 the close cousin of the ST750LX003, the ST95005620AS (on the same spec sheet as indicated above) would be a much better choice. It requires a full one watt less power and much the same speed. The tradeoff is 250gb less space and a slower ESATA spec. IDK about you folx, but ESATA is so new that I have never used it in a production environment.   \n"

It is a hard disk and can mount CD/DVD, floppies and hard disks.  \nIf we activate all these capabilities, after booting, from BIOS screen we can see :  \n\nZALMAN External HDD  \nZALMAN Virtual CD-ROM  \nxxx Virtual Floppy (xxx: first 8 characters of the .ima file name)  \nyyy Virtual HDD (yyy: first 8 characters of the .dsk file name)  \nzzz Virtual Memory (zzz: first 8 characters of the .rmd file name)  \n\nFrom VE-300 screen we see a floppy icon associated with the .ima file  \nWhen Virtual HDD (floppy or hard disk) is activated, a special icon is displayed (refer to paper documentation). CD/DVD mount  \nhas other specific icon.  \n\nBackup utility can create virtual HDD (VHDD) disk types: floppy (.ima)/removable (.rmd) /Fixed disk (.dsk)  \n\u003d\\\u003e each VHDD mount is remembered (cumulative), so to unmount them you need to go to Menu, then Advanced, then select Unmount VHDD  \n\nMy experience about booting from virtual HDD :  \nCreate 4GB fixed disk image using Zalman backup utility.  \nMount it (VHDD) with Zalman control screen.  \nCreate and format a partition on the disk mounted (using EaseUS Partition Master, or bootice.exe).  \nRun Bootice to check/set the MBR/PBR of the disk to NT 5.x  \nCopy content of a VMware XP disk (ntldr, boot.ini, windows, Program Files, Documents and Settings directories)  \nBoot the VHDD on real machine : BSOD xx but it is expected.  \n\nSo VHDD bootability seems to be built-in in VE-300. Some assumptions/questions:  \n1- Should the hard disk file be contiguous? (assume yes, use WinContig to unfragment).  \nThis means the PC memory must be bigger than the hard disk image size.  \n2- Does it mean that with VE-300 we can have a kind of XP VHD possibility to boot XP inside a disk image?  \n(note that we cannot boot XP VHD since XP does not support it).  \n\nEdit:  \niso emulation that works: Knoppix, Linux Mint, Puppy, Parted Magic, Windows iso  \niso emulation that does not work: Trinity Rescue Kit, Damn Small Linux  \n\nAlso what is interesting that the type of connection (USB 2.0 or USB 3.0) is indicated at the LED screen,  \nbut also through the HDD LED disk activity color : white if USB 2.0, and blue if USB 3.0 (blue is seemingly the  \ndefault color for all USB 3.0 cables/connectors).   \n"

Others Linux distributions could be booted either with Zalman ISO emulation,  \nor by VHDD using the Universal USB Installer. So I kept my collections of iso in separate sub-directories of _iso, and name  \n$VHDD as sub-directory to store hard disk images, so it will be presented first (sort order).  \n\n- Curiously under VMware menu VM/Removable devices, the Zalman is seen as Fujitsu ZM-VE300 !  \n\n- There is no noticeable differences by creating VHDD image with Zalman (using its backup utility) using fixed (.dsk)  \nor removable (.rmd) disk. The disk icon in Windows OS did show the difference. For Win7/Win8 VHDD, you must choose  \nfixed disk (.dsk) though, otherwise Windows Update terminate with error 80070005 (access denied).  \n\n- After creating the VHDD file, do not mount it immediately with Imdisk then format, since you will get big floppy format.  \nYou must mount the VHDD with Zalman, then use a partition manager (OS, EaseUS Partition Master, bootice...) to partition  \nand correctly set MBR/PBR (e.g. create one ext4 partition, and one swap partition for Linux).  \n\n- Surprisingly when I want to increase an existing VHDD size, I delete the file, then recreate with the same name.  \nAfter mounting it with Zalman, curiously under the partition manager, I got the identical content, identical partition size,  \nwith an extra unallocated partition. So I just use the partition manager to increase the first partition, without any  \ndata lost! But it should be a lucky situation, probably not a recommended way.  \n\n- To unmount all VHDD, long press the wheel, then go to Advanced, then Unmount VHDD.  \n\n- To force a refresh (unplug/plug) of the disk content, long press the Backup button, then Plug-out... message,  \npress the wheel button.  \n\n- For Trinity Rescue Toolkit VHDD, I have to use FAT32 format, then use grub4dos to boot syslinux  \nsyslinux.exe -f X: X:\\\\syslinux.bin  \ntitle Load syslinux menu  \nchainloader /syslinux.bin  \n\n- What is strange is after mounting VHDD with Zalman, the remaining of the disk is read-only? Is it a bug or a feature?  \n\n- The Write-Protect function (set all the disk read-only) works well.   \n"

      "content": "\u003e Put succinctly I need to convert the Zalman.iso to a useable .bin file ?? Its only.... firmware !!!  \n\nYears ago when I first bought my VE200 I played with various version of the i-odd firmware and was able to go back and forth between the flavors of firmware without problem, so I KNOW for a FACT that it can be done. It is possible to get back to Zalman firmware. Sadly, I did not document the process, nor did I retain copies of the firmware and tools that I used to do so. However if I recall correctly, I had to use an i-odd utility to flash a very early version of the i-odd firmware. If I recall correctly, the early firmware writing (flashing) tool did not care so much the file format of the firmware image itself and was able to flash from i-odd to Zalman and vice versa. All of the firmwares to do so were very early versions of the i-odd firmware, early flashing tool(s) and early Zalman firmwares because I do recall that each time I flashed to/from i-iodd/Zalman I then need to apply updated firmware to get it back to stock.  \n\nI did a bit of google searching, and found some firmware that may be of interest. Keep in mind that the earliest tools are for Win 32bit only, and I would have been using Windows XP 32bit at the time. The most curious sets of firmware I found are called \"_iso_firm_iodd-to-ZMVE200-1.00.00-64.rar\" and \"_iso_firm_ZMVE200-to-iodd_v1.42.65.rar\". As the file names indicate, these may be ther versions of firmware that allow you to cross over to and from iodd/Zalman. I do not know for sure that this is the case, but it appears so. I have not tested them. However if you google those file names you should be able to download them and other older utilities. Agfain, i have NOT teste these particular files but am only suggesting you investigate those filenames. Also if you look way earlier in this topic, you will see a post by myself listing som of the firmwares I have played with. Googling those filenames may bring further results. Good luck! And let us know how you get along.   \n"

      "content": "@Wally\n\nI have seen machines that fail to allow booting from the Zalman for various reasons, some completely unknown. Somtimes Bios simply does not detect, but usb ports check out just fine. Some BIOS detects and identifies properly, but will not allow you to select it as a bootable device despite all bios options set to enable it. Some allow you to select, but simply will not boot. Some will allow you to select and boot but only if other obscure measures are taken such as only working on particular ports or removing all other optical drives etc. But never, ever have i seen it get detected as a additional USB hub in the BIOS or in an operating systems enumeration of attached devices. I have even seen it get detected as a different brand of optical, but in in those cases it still worked fine.\n\nI\u0027m not faulting the Zalman for any of this. As a fairly unique and still uncommon device it will find machines that will deal with it in quirky ways at times. That does not suprise me. It still works as intended in the vast majority of machines I\u0027ve used it on but never has it failed due to being misidentified as a hub, or an optical drive behind a hub.\n\n"

Don\u0027t know that much about USB, but I had always presumed that the SanDisk U3 identified the CDROM as hub attached because the SanDisk had no other way of identifying itself as two devices (e.g, an IDE disk and a CDROM. Because the ZALMAN can appear as multiple devices at the same time (e.g., a CDROM and one or more floppies, for example), I thought it likely that the ZALMAN might have to stick in a \"virtual hub\" just as an artifact so that it could register as multiple devices. Apparently, that is not the way USB works, which in turn would suggest that the SanDisk used the hub artifact for some other reason in doing its CDROM attachment. I wonder what the reason was.  \n\n"

      "content": "\u003e PS: Is it possible to install Linux on an IMAGE that can be placed on the Zalman and booted from it?\n\nI can answer the PS... YES it is very possible! I believe there is some information several posts/pages back.\n\nTo give a short version... Using a computer that the Zalman works correctly on, and that is set to boot first from optical disk:\n\n1) Create a contigious empty file in the _iso folder (or sub folder) named something like ubuntu.img, big enough to hold the minimum recommended install size (8GB for ubuntu, I personally use 20GB).\n\nOption 2a) Mount the ubuntu.img file on the Zalman, and boot from an optical drive with the Linux disk. Install Linux to the proper drive (the image file should show up as a drive the size you created). Make sure not to install on your computers hard drive!\n\nOption 2b) Put the Linuix installation ISO image in the _iso folder. Mount both the iso and the img files. Boot the iso image and install linux to the proper drive (the image file should show up as a drive the size you created). Make sure not to install on your computers hard drive!\n\n3) Enjoy your bootable portable persistant Linux installation! You will have to mount the image on the Zalman, and ensure that the computer is set to boot from usb device (something you usually don\u0027t have to do to boot from an iso image).\n\n4) Optionally put the Super Grub Boot Disk iso on the Zalman. Mount both the supergrub and the linix image. It wiil now boot supergrub as an optical drive, and you can find and boot your linux image. This can be helpful for computers that have a hard time (or are just a pain) booting from usb devices.\n\nNotes: It will only be as portable as the version of linux will allow, but I have booted ubuntu this way on several computers. Also, there is a down side to booting an image on the Zalman... the main zalman drive (root) will only show up (if at all) as read only. Meaning you can\u0027t store files on the zalman, except inside the image you have mounted. But... you can mount up to 4 images at once...\n\n**Edited by maximus57, 12 February 2013 - 11:57 PM.**\n"

Then add the .imgPTN file to your Easy2Boot USB drive.\n\nYou cannot use these .imgPTN files on a Zalman because they are not whole, bootable disk images (they are images which start at the start of the partition volume).\n\n*Actually, if you rename the .imgPTN file to .RMD and copy it to the Zalman, the Zalman can mount it and the contents are accessible as a mounted Volume on Windows (!) - but you cannot boot from it.*\n\nTo make bootable .RMD images from your USB drives, use RMPrepUSB Drive-\\\u003eFile (similar to \u0027dd\u0027 utility) and make a whole disk image of the USB drive. This is rather wasteful of space though because a 16GB USB drive will result in a 16GB image file (even if there are only 2GB of files on it). To get around this, you can format the USB disk to a smaller partition size and set the end size for RMPrepUSB - Drive-\\\u003eFile to P1 (end of partition 1) instead of the end of the disk.\n\nThe other alternative is to *install*Easy2Boot to your Zalman. That is why Easy2Boot uses the \\\\_ISO folder.\n\ni.e. install Easy2Boot onto the Zalman HDD (you don\u0027t need to re-format it) and copy your ISO files to the \\\\_ISO\\\\MAINMENU (and other folders).\n\nYou can now boot from the Zalman as a bootable USB HDD and run E2B OR use the Zalman controls to select any ISO file and boot from the Zalman as a USB CD drive.\n\nFor a good USB stick, I recommend the SanDisk Cruzer Extreme USB 3.0 64GB.\n\n"

      "content": "While I have not tried this myself with actual flash drive tools, you should also be able to use the Zalman itself to create and work with USB style images.\n\n1) Create a file of the desired size of the image in the _iso folder. I use contig.exe since the file must be contiguous. I also prefer to make the extension .ima as it seems easier to work with outside using the Zalman.\n\n2) Select that image file in the Zalman menu.\n\n3) Your operating system should recognize that there is an unformatted disk attached, and possibly ask if you would like to format it. Format it as fat32, the same as most flash drives.\n\n4) Now use whatever tool you wish to build the bootable flash drive using the drive letter of the newly formatted drive. Some tools may complain or not work if they sense it as a hard drive and not a true flash drive. You should also be able to do a sector level copy from an actual flash drive to the new virtual drive, but you must have created the drive at least as big as or bigger than the original.\n\n5) Repeat as needed for your different desired flash drives.\n\n6) Enjoy booting from them!\n\nThis creates images that boot with read/write capability. The downside to this method is that when any read/write image is loaded, the rest of the Zalman becomes read only. If I remember correctly, you can mount up to four image files on the Zalman at once, and still also have a single ISO image mounted.\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n"

The way I stumbled across, which is to hold down the wheel on the side, then connect a USB cable, this defaults the drive to DUAL mode, and from there you can load the firmware (ISO) onto your drive, select it, and run it.\n\u003e \u003e 2. Remove the drive from the Zalman, and connect it to your computer some other way, load the firmware on and then put it back in the Zalman drive to flash the firmware. (This way didn\u0027t work for me due to other freezing issues.)\n\u003e \u003e\n\u003e \u003e Once the firmware is on the device and you\u0027ve flashed it, then you should have a good device again, and the latest firmware (a couple of minor changes I spotted, nothing major.)\n\u003e \u003e\n\u003e \u003e Hope this helps anyone stuck with this issue.\n\n"

      "content": "\u003e Ok what I meant is, when booting some live Linux distributions of a UFD via GRUB4DOS, when they try to mount the live media file system such as squashfs or whatever it is called and others, it fails and drops you to a shell prompt. If you are lucky, you can mount the file system and continue booting. For some the solution would be to copy this live media file to the UFD while also preserving the path (same path as within the ISO) and that normally works. However for some it doesn\u0027t and this is probably because the cdrom device is hard coded in the init script and it only searches CDs. Now if somehow ZM-VE200 fools the system to appear as a CD device, booting this ISOs will work. If you don\u0027t mind, see if you can get G-DATA Live AV to work by simply dropping the ISO.\n\nYou can literally answer the original question yourself. Does it boot from an actual CD/DVD/BD if the image has been recorded on the respective media and the CD/DVD/BD drive is known to be bootable?\n\nIn that case the answer is very likely a resounding yes.\n\nThe possible exception that I have had with the VE-400 is to pick the right USB port. Try them all in order, if the first doesn\u0027t work. Personally I only ever had trouble on a few USB3 ports on early machines including USB3. Moving to USB2 fixed the problem, occasionally even to another USB3 slot (perhaps it\u0027s the issue with the sloppily designed connectors?). The takeaway for me was that I need to try to make it work.\n\nI also bought two ISOsticks which are now just very expensive microSD readers. They only worked on one machine out of dozens of tested machines. If the intent is to save space and weight by cutting down on physical media, ISOstick let me down way too many times. The ZM VE-400 never did.\n\n(yeah, I realize that this is about VE-200, but the principles would be the same, since the actual drive gets emulated ... unlike ISOstick which poses as some boot device the first time around - carrying host-specific boot code, and then boots the ISO you pick ... and yeah, the Zalman also worked on a PowerMac, when the ISOstick never could)\n\n"
