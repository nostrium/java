      "content": "Heres my situation, i am a computer tech that is responsible for 35 pcs a day all of them are different model laptop and desktops, all running at least vista basic. I need a method to boot from a usb HDD so i can run diagnostic apps. Right now im using bartpe but its a pain to rebuild the ISO everytime i need to change the diagnostic apps. What i was thinking was to install xp or win 7 32 bit onto the drive from a laptop and then move it from pc to pc. So when a change needs to be made i simple boot it-make the change and shutdown. BUT i have had problems with booting different pcs it will BSOD, im guessing cuz of the different chipsets/USB...is there a way to do it thus way but somehow strip away the USB/CHIPSET drivers at shutdown so when a diff pc is booted it will simply imstall the new drivers?   \n"
