      "content": "So here\u0027s the situation !  \n\nophcrack live cd uses slitaz linux distro.  \n\nBy default slitaz login automatically in to a account name \"tux\" , which don\u0027t have administrator privileges.  \n\nAfter login a script named \"launch.sh\" runs automatically. (which finds tables on the cd)  \n\nI have added ophcrack live cd to a multiboot dvd. But when I run the ophcrack it stops with an error \" tables not found\".  \n\nAfter getting this error i tried to relaunch the script \"launch.sh\" from command-line.  \n\nI have found this:  \nif i run the script as the user \"tux\" , i get this error again.  \nif i run the script as the user \"root\" , the tables are found.  \n\nps:  \nI have run the original iso file in vmware and it runs fine and tables were found.  \nbut when i run in multiboot dvd it stops with this error.   \n"
