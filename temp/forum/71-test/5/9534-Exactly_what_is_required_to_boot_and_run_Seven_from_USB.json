Wasn\u0027t able to make a functional vistaPE or SevenPE using winbuilder (Still working on my own version of a hyperaccelerated 7600 for USBdisk)... I might not be releasing mine publicly..   \n\nIf you go bart\u0027s route (setup to 32bit shell) then you would only need to give the usbdisk an nt60 bootsector... To boot any version of full blown seven from a USBdisk you will need: an nt60 bootsector, a HDFS\\~NTFS filesystem (a usbdisk is udf/cdfs), a Atapi mode PCI\\~ACHI over USB workaround, and alteration of one line of code in the setup.exe file.  \n\nUntil I release my version of Seven for usbdisk, I would suggest using **SOME WAREZ** to keep from getting all your code stolen and reverse engineered before public release.  \n\nThe Magizian   \n"

Then you would move your project from being warez to being something a bit more credible.  \n\nRegards,  \nGalapo.   \n"
