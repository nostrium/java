      "content": "Following is my experience with BartPE (UBCD4Win in fact) and TrueCrypt (TC).  \nAt least you need to add TrueCrypt plug-in for BartPE, so the protected driver will be loaded.  \nOnce the whole disk in encrypted, after preboot authentication (PBA) phase, TrueCrypt code in MBR  \nwill decode the data during real-mode disk access, afterwards normally the protected mode TrueCrypt driver  \nloaded by BartPE would be active in turn. This is how I understand the TC mechanism.  \n\nUnfortunately I did not success to get the whole process running. As far as I remember, there is a loading   \nerror message at the beginning of BartPE.  \n\nSince then I use another method. Normally BartPE/VistaPE/Win7PE does not contain confidential data and so  \ndoes not need encryption. I use bootice (or Hitachi microfilter) to partition the USB key into 2 partitions,  \nthe first one is visible by normal Windows, it contains normal BartPE + Hitachi microfilter plug-in + TC plugin (so that when loaded the second partition truecrypted could be mounted and seen). The second partition (active) contains XP OS and is encrypted.  \n\nAt USB key boot, I have grub4dos using menu.lst to choose between normal BartPE (first partition boot), and TrueCrypt (second partition, encrypted) boot (by using grub4dos chainloading the TC MBR). My second partition contains USBooted ( [http://www.usboot.org)](http://www.usboot.org) \"External link\") XP.  \n\nOf course if you do not need full OS encrypted boot, the second partition could be simply data partition, and you can mount it inside BartPE (or from other computers with TC).   \n"
