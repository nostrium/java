I\u0027m making a factory maintenance disc for a friend that includes(Page 1):  \nDisk Commander  \nDSL  \nFreeNAS  \nOphCrack  \nWindows PE 1.8  \n\nPage 2 has a bunch of disk prep tools.  \n\nDSL and FreeNAS were cake but I\u0027m running into some trouble getting OphCrack 2.3.1 to work right. It has been entirely too long since I\u0027ve made memdisk images and I need some help with the config.  \n\nEverything looks clean enough.  \nI don\u0027t need to rename the boot dir.  \nAfter this I\u0027m just adding WinPE 1.8 and I\u0027m done.  \nOverall project is expected to hit 710MB after WinPE.  \n\nHow do I start on the image?  \nWhat size is needed?  \nWhat references do I need?   \n"
