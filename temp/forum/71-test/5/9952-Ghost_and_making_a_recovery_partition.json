      "content": "I\u0027m new to forums so please forgive me if I post this in the wrong forum, but I believe my question may have something to do with what your topic is about. My question is for jaclaz or someone else who may have knowledge of Grub.  \n\nWatch this video, this is exactly what I would like to do to my system, except for having Vista of course.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v\u003dHrljirWivBQ  \n\nMy in-laws have a computer that they would like me to setup for them just like this video shows. I have a 40GB hard drive with 2 partitions. I have already installed XP on the 1st partition(30GB) with Grub4Dos loading from the MBR, which is booting fine. The 2nd partition(10GB) has nothing but ghost.exe and mouse.com which is not bootable. Ialso have a backup ghost image, image.gho.  \n\nThe video shows the system booting up Grub with XP, Vista, and an Automatic Recovery option, which is what I want to setup for them because they keep corrupting there O/S. When you execute Automatic Recovery from the Grub menu, the computer automatically restores a backup image by ghost which I assume is ran from a command line in Grub or from an .ima file like they are talking about in this post. Can someone comment on this post and provide some very good detailed instructions or How-To Guide on how to do this. I am very new to Grub, but I have a lot of O/S experience and somewhat familiar with Ghost.  \n\nThank in advance.   \n"

      "content": "Well, that video is a \"simplified\" example of a recovery partition.  \n\nThe point is that if the partition where the small OS and the image are residing is normally visible, it will be \"botched\" before or later by the technically impaired in-laws, so a slightly more sophisticated approach is needed.  \n\nYou actually do not \"need\" grub4dos for this. (though you can use it to this effect, in other words grub4dos can do almost anything, but for simple things, simpler approaches may be better).  \n\nThe \"usual\" way to do so is using a special MBR code.  \n\nThere are at least two Freewares available:  \n[http://www.boot-land...p?showtopic\u003d334](http://www.boot-land.net/forums/index.php?showtopic\u003d334 \"External link\")  \n[http://www.terabyteu...ee-software.htm](http://www.terabyteunlimited.com/downloads-free-software.htm \"External link\")  \n\nStart reading these:  \n[http://www.boot-land...?showtopic\u003d8296](http://www.boot-land.net/forums/index.php?showtopic\u003d8296 \"External link\")  \n[http://www.boot-land...?showtopic\u003d6893](http://www.boot-land.net/forums/index.php?showtopic\u003d6893 \"External link\")  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nAnd these:  \n[http://www.boot-land...?showtopic\u003d8761](http://www.boot-land.net/forums/index.php?showtopic\u003d8761 \"External link\")  \n[http://www.terabyteu...icle.php?id\u003d277](http://www.terabyteunlimited.com/kb/article.php?id\u003d277 \"External link\")  \n\nTo get the idea.  \n\nOnce you have a more clear understanding of the things needed, we will talk of details, and I\u0027ll split this into a new thread.  \n\njaclaz   \n"

      "content": "All these threads are good information and I thank you for posting them.  \n\nPersonally, if this were for me, I would set this up with a full menu of Grub booting several O/S\u0027s. However, we are talking about my in-laws. So, with that being said. I think the best way would be to have it where you select a hotkey only to recover the partition, like the F11 method. But there is some things that I don\u0027t understand about this method. Like, deploying WinPE with a .Wim file. I don\u0027t really need a whole other bootable O/S. I just would like for it to boot XP as normal until it gets corrupted and then select a certain key on bootup to automatically recover a backup ghost partition over the corrupted one by command line string, (no intervention by in-laws).  \n\nI would like it to be as easy as possible. What aboout one of the last two methods, where you select the F key or something like that where it overwrites from a hidden partition. The instructions to these two methods sounded kind of easy, if it really works. I\u0027m just not to familiar with any other type of imaging software than Ghost. What would you recommend, because I am looking forward to starting this project? I know your recommendation would be an honest one.  \n\nThanks in advance.   \n"
