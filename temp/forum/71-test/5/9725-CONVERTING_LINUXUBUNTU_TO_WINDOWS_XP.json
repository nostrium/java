All data will be lost that isn\u0027t first backed up to CD/DVD, ext. drive etc.**   \n\n*\"without an optical driver\"* - Can you boot to XP install disc? You may need to check BIOS settings and change boot order to CD first.   \n\nYou need to format the hard drive (ntfs) and do a clean install of XP from the Windows install/boot CD. This is DOS like interface (no gui) and can be a bit confusing to beginners but basically walks you through the delete/format/install steps.  \n\n**If** or when you have access to a gui (graphic user interface) type boot CD, like LiveXP etc. you can boot to that (XP like desktop and tools) and perform all these actions from the comfort of an *XP like* desktop.  \n\nIf any of this sounds too technical, you may need to consult (hire) a local computer tech to help out, they\u0027ll appreciate your business ![:drunk:](http://reboot.pro/public/style_emoticons/default/drunk.gif)   \n"
