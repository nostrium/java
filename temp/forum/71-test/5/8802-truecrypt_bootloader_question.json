I just dont know enough about whats happening in the boot proccess.  \n\nIm learning.. but the fact that this USB stick boots fine without truecrypt leads me to belive that the TC bootloader is missing something it expects or not expecting something it sees. wish I knew.  \n\nunless otherwise instructed, my plan is to start over. since I was using USBoot I never had to nlite my XP to manually install the SATA drivers for this machine, it just detected them and I pointed it to them.  \n\nI am hoping if I start over and install clean slipstream w/SATA then USBoot prepair then truecrypt it I will have success but if not I plan to try MRs grub4dos wiki instructions even though multi booting it isnt what I really need.  \n\nI\u0027ll probably end up with alot more knowledge in the process and then find out it was something really simple.  \n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\nthanks for your input.   \n"

Zero out first, say 100 sectors:  \n[http://www.boot-land...?...\u003d4015\\\u0026st\u003d21](http://www.boot-land.net/forums/index.php?showtopic\u003d4015\u0026st\u003d21 \"External link\")  \n2.

M$ also has a format tool for flash drives, I havnt read any mention of it on Bootland or anywhere else so I didnt bother to dload it.  \n\nnow that I am some what familiar with boot logging I will try to see what the boot logs indicate in regards to this problem as soon as I can.  \n\nthats very helpful screencap info!  \n\nI rechecked the drive in beebelbrox after restart and it no longer indicates FAT16B, after restart it indicates NTFS  \n\nedit: For the record, you don\u0027t need to install a specific app to do a screen capture, you only need pressing the Print Screen key and paste in a new PAINT image (and if it\u0027s the case CROP the relevant part and re-paste into a new PAINT image)\n\njust tryed it and that is Slick Jaclaz! thanks!   \n"
